							<p>Commenting leads are representatives of an organisation who collate feedback on NICE consultations from colleagues within their organisation. They are also responsible for submitting their organisation's consultation response to NICE.</p>
							<p>Leads are now able to do this online using our commenting system but will require a set of permissions to be added to their NICE account, which can be assigned on request. </p>

							<div className="grid">
								<div data-g="8">
									<h2>How does it work?</h2>
									<p>You only need to request the commenting lead permissions once. Then you will be able to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>share the online consultation with colleagues from your organisation</li>
										<li>review and edit their comments</li>
										<li>combine the collated comments into a single response</li>
										<li>submit your organisation's final response.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>You can only be the lead for one organisation at a time. Once you are lead you can manage multiple consultations simultaneously.</p>
									<p>Ideally each consultation will only have one commenting lead. If you need to add a second lead for a consultation then you can, but only one of you will be able to submit the final response to NICE.</p>
									<p>If you need to change the lead during a consultation you can email us. However, if the outgoing lead has already submitted a response then the new lead will not be able to edit it or submit another response for that consultation.</p>
