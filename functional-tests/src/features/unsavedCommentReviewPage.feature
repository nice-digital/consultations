Feature: User unable to submit when they have unsaved comments on Review page
	As a user of consultations
	We want to be able to login to make a comment
	We want to be able to comment at the Document level
	We want to be warned if I attempt to navigate away while having unsaved Comments

	Background:
		Given I open the url "412/1/recommendations"
		When I log into accounts with username "IDAM_EMAIL2" and password "IDAM_PASSWORD"

	Scenario: User is unable to Submit when there are unsaved comments
		Given I comment on a Document
		Then I expect the comment box title contains "document"
		When I add the comment "This comment" and submit
		When I navigate to the Review Page
		And I add the comment ". must be saved" to the first in the list on the review page
		And I complete the mandatory response submission questions
		And I click submit my response button
		Then I expect the alert caution to contain "I understand that once I have submitted my response, I will not be able to edit my comments or provide additional information."
		And I click yes submit my response button
		Then I expect the feedback message "You have unsaved changes. Please save or delete before submitting your response" to be displayed
		Given I delete all comments on the page
