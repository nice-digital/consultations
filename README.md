## What is it?
This service provides a way for NICE stakeholders to comment directly on NICE consultations and documents to provide their viewpoint; and a way for NICE teams to request comments and process them for response which doesnâ€™t require repetitive manual handling.

### Background
Consultation is a key part of developing NICE guidance, including NICE quality standards. The consultation processes enable external organisations and individuals to comment on guidance content at specific stages in the development process, and feed into the decision-making process.

### Why are we doing this?
What is our motivation for building this product or service?
- NICE efficiencies
- Increase stakeholder engagement
- Improve quality of responses given by NICE

### Who are our users?
- Internal teams at NICE who consult on the guidance they are producing by collecting comments from external stakeholders
- Our external stakeholders are the people who the guidance and standards that NICE produces affect and who want to provide their views on the development of these, so that their needs and priorities are reflected in the final guidance

### What outcome will users get from this service?
What problem will it solve for people?
- Less manual handling when collating comments
- Less variation for stakeholders between different types of consultation - Secondary
- Able to comment against specific parts of a document or more generically
- Easier for NICE to tell which part of the document is being commented on

### What outcome are we looking for?
What problem will it solve for our organisation?
- Efficiency savings for NICE by reducing manual handling during collation

### What are our key metrics?
What do we need to measure against these outcomes?
- Time taken to collate results
- End to end time taken for consultation process
- Number of comments received
- Number of distinct organisations commenting
- Improved quality of responses / lower error rate

### Architecture

Consultations sits below [Varnish](https://github.com/nhsevidence/varnish) so is under the main niceorg domain. It pulls data from [InDev](https://github.com/nhsevidence/publicationsindev) via an API and stores data in SQL Server.

## Set up
1. Install [KDiff](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/) to be able see diffs from integration tests
2. Install [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server) and [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms)
3. Install [Redis](https://redis.io/) and make sure it is running.
4. Add 127.0.0.1	niceorg to your hosts file
5. Restore Consultations database in SSMS and copy database connection string
6. Clone the project `git clone git@github.com:nhsevidence/consultations.git`
7. Open *Consultations.sln*
8. Paste database connection string into DefaultConnection in secrets.json file
9. Press F5 to run the project in debug mode
10. Dependencies will download (npm and NuGet) so be patient on first run
11. The app will run in IIS Express on http://localhost:52679/
12. cd into *consultations\Comments\ClientApp* and run `npm start` if Startup is using `UseProxyToSpaDevelopmentServer`. This runs a react dev server on http://localhost:3000/.
13. Run `npm test` in a separate window to run client side tests in watch mode

### Gotchas
- `spa.UseReactDevelopmentServer` can be slow so try using `spa.UseProxyToSpaDevelopmentServer("http://localhost:3000");` instead within [Startup.cs](Comments/Startup.cs).
- Need to ensure that nothing else is running on port 80, otherwise you will encounter a socket exception error when running in debug.

## Tests

The project uses serveral layers of tests:

- C# low-level unit tests, run via xUnit, asserted with Shouldly. See [Comments.Test/UnitTests](Comments.Test/UnitTests).
- C# 'integration' tests (approval based of server rendered HTML), run via xUnit, asserted with Shouldly, diffed with Kdiff. See [Comments.Test/IntegrationTests](Comments.Test/IntegrationTests).
- JavaScript unit tests via jest. See [Comments/ClientApp/src](Comments/ClientApp/src).
- Functional high-level tests, via webdriver.io.

## Entity Framework Migrations
We use Code first Entity Framework migrations to update the consultations database  

To update the database   
 - add a new property to the relevent class in Consultations > Comments > Models > EF
 - in visual studio go to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console
 - in the package manager console window run the command Add-Migration [give your migration a useful name] eg Add-Migration AddCommentCreationDate  
	This will create a new migrations script in Consultations > Comments > Migrations
 - when the comment collection is next hit the changes in the migration script will be applied to SQL.   
 	A new column will be created in __EFMigrationHistory to flag that the migration has been run.
