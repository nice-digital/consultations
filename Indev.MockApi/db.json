People with the condition have a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, and have worsening physical disability, mobility loss and respiratory dysfunction. SMA can be grouped into 5 main types (0 to 4), based on the age of onset and the maximum motor function reached. SMA type 0, the most severe, affects babies before birth. The babies do not develop any motor skills and often survive for only a few weeks after birth. Babies with type 1 SMA are unable to sit or roll because of severe muscle weakness, which gets worse over time. The muscle weakness also affects swallowing and breathing, and typically results in death within 2 years if respiratory support is not used. In type 2 SMA, the onset of symptoms is between 7 months and 18 months. People with this condition can sit independently at diagnosis. However, progressive loss of motor function means they have a reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. In type 3 SMA, there are varying degrees of muscle weakness, which appear between 18 months and 18 years. People with this condition can have a normal lifespan, and walk or sit unaided at some point, but many lose mobility and other functions over time. Type 4 SMA is the least severe and affects adults, who may have milder motor impairment and live a normal lifespan. The clinical experts explained that type 0 and type 4 SMA are rarely diagnosed in clinical practice in the NHS in England. The patient experts explained that SMA is a progressive disorder so all patients will experience more severe symptoms over time. The committee concluded that SMA is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disorder that affects all aspects of daily life.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam\" id=\"398-1-the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"398-1-3.2\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.2</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The patient experts commented that the SMA classification system does not always reflect the full extent of the disease. The boundaries between the different SMA types are blurred and can be subjective. They also explained that it was not originally intended to define populations who were eligible for treatment. One patient expert with a child with type 3 SMA described how progressive loss of motor function has affected all daily activities and being unable to access treatments such as nusinersen has a big effect on physical and mental health. The committee understood that risdiplam's marketing authorisation includes types 1 to 3 SMA as currently defined by the SMA classification system and these definitions were also used in the clinical evidence (see section 3.5). The committee acknowledged the limitations of the current SMA classification system but concluded that it had been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families\" id=\"398-1-sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\" data-heading-type=\"section\">SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"398-1-3.3\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.3</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The clinical and patient experts explained that most people with SMA need constant support. This can include full-time care and attention, needing physical effort (such as lifting and carrying) and causing loss of sleep for patients and carers, stress, and fear about loss of abilities. One patient expert with a child with type 2 SMA described how living with the condition can put considerable strain on relationships with other family members and friends. Siblings have a restricted social circle because of the fear of respiratory infections, and often act as young carers. As well as dealing with the physical and mental stress as the condition progresses, the financial burden also increases as more supportive equipment is needed. Another patient expert with type 2 SMA described the fear of losing fine motor skills and how being unable to work would affect the whole family. All these factors have a large effect on family members' health-related quality of life. The patient experts emphasised how caring for people with SMA affects the whole family and can cause physical, mental and financial issues. The committee concluded that SMA has a substantial effect on the quality of life of patients, caregivers and their families.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Comparator\" id=\"398-1-comparator\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"comparator\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Comparator</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam\" id=\"398-1-best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"398-1-3.4\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.4</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Nusinersen is the only disease-modifying treatment currently available for SMA. The clinical and patient experts explained that many people with SMA have spinal fusion so cannot have nusinersen because it is delivered by intrathecal injection and requires access to the lower spine. They commented that an oral treatment option would be welcome and would also address several issues related to the delivery of nusinersen including the use of sedation, radiographic imaging and anxiety associated with lumbar puncture. Nusinersen is recommended in NICE's guidance TA588 through a managed access agreement. This makes nusinersen available while more data is collected. However, nusinersen is not routinely commissioned in the NHS in England. So, current treatment for many people is best supportive care. The aim is to control symptoms, maintain movement and function for as long as possible and improve quality of life. This involves a multidisciplinary approach including respiratory, gastroenterology and orthopaedic care, as well as nutritional support, physiotherapy, assistive technologies, occupational therapy and social care. However, the clinical and patient experts emphasised that these supportive treatments do not affect disease progression, so people with SMA will ultimately become dependent on their families and carers. The committee was aware of an ongoing highly specialised technology evaluation for <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-hst10026\" target=\"_top\">onasemnogene abeparvovec for treating spinal muscular atrophy type 1</a>. It was aware that this treatment was recommended in draft guidance for routine commissioning for some babies 12 months or younger with SMA type 1. However, it understood that the guidance was not final and therefore onasemnogene abeparvovec could not be included as a comparator. The NHS England commissioning expert described the potential treatment pathway if risdiplam were to be recommended as a treatment option alongside nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec. They explained that repeated treatment switching would only be expected in exceptional circumstances, related to issues such as fertility or side effects. The committee recognised that treatment options used routinely in the NHS in England are currently limited and there is an unmet need for people with SMA. It recalled that best supportive care is routinely used in clinical practice in the NHS in England. It concluded that best supportive care was the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Clinical evidence\" id=\"398-1-clinical-evidence\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"clinical-evidence\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Clinical evidence</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3\" id=\"398-1-evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"398-1-3.5\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.5</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The main clinical effectiveness evidence for risdiplam came from 2 clinical studies:</p>\r\n          <ul class=\"itemizedlist indented\">\r\n            <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n              <p>SUNFISH, which is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre (excluding UK sites), phase 2, placebo-controlled trial.

RAINBOWFISH is a phase 2, single-arm study of babies 6 weeks or younger who had been genetically diagnosed with SMA but did not have symptoms. JEWELFISH is an open-label, single-arm study for SMA types 1, 2 and 3 in people of 6 months to 60 years who had previously enrolled in the MOONFISH study or who had previously had nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec or olesoxime. The ERG considered that although SUNFISH excluded patients with type 3 SMA who could walk, this group accounts for a small proportion of SMA cases. It also noted that SUNFISH and FIREFISH excluded patients who had previous treatment (see section 3.6). The committee noted the age restrictions used in both studies. It was aware that some babies may be diagnosed with type 1 SMA when they are older than 7 months. The clinical experts explained that the study populations were generally representative of patients with SMA in the NHS in England. The committee concluded that the evidence presented for SMA types 1 to 3 was suitable for decision making.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen\" id=\"398-1-there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\" data-heading-type=\"section\">There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"398-1-3.6\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.6</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The company did not present any clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for people who have had nusinersen.

The results from FIREFISH were compared against pre-defined performance criteria, based on natural history data for patients with type 1 SMA. The results (see table 2) suggest that after 12 months of treatment with risdiplam, more patients were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds than would be expected for patients with type 1 SMA. Overall survival was 93% (90% confidence interval 82.2% to 97.1%). After technical engagement, both the company and the ERG used the company's matched adjusted indirect comparison to model the treatment effect of risdiplam compared with best supportive care for type 1 SMA. The indirect comparison showed improvements in motor function (such as sitting with and without support), ventilation-free survival and overall survival (the company considers the data to be confidential so it cannot be reported here). The company and the ERG agreed that improvements seen in both SUNFISH and FIREFISH were clinically important. The patient experts described their experiences of using risdiplam and noted improvements in motor function, lung capacity, energy levels and stamina. They explained that even very small improvements in fine motor skills and upper limb function were very important because they allow patients to maintain independence. They emphasised that although the studies showed improvements in motor function, they would also highly value a treatment that keeps the disease stable and stops it getting worse. The committee agreed that the clinical evidence showed improved motor function with risdiplam but noted that overall survival data were only available for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n      <div class=\"informaltable\">\r\n        <table frame=\"all\" border=\"1\" id=\"ID0E2F\">\r\n          <caption>\r\n            <strong>Table 1 Results from SUNFISH for SMA types 2 and 3 at 12‑month follow up</strong>\r\n          </caption>\r\n          <thead>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Outcome</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Risdiplam n=120 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Placebo n=60 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Difference, risdiplam minus placebo (95% CI)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>p-value</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </thead>\r\n          <tbody>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>MFM-32 total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.36 (0.38)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.19 (0.52) </p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.55 (0.30 to 2.81)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02*, 0.02**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>HFMSE total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.95 (0.33)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.37 (0.46)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.58 (–0.53 to 1.69)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.30**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>RULM total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.61 (0.31)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02 (0.43)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.59 (0.55 to 2.62)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.05*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Caregiver-reported SMAIS score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.65 (0.50)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.91 (0.67)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>2.55 (0.93 to 4.17)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Patient-reported SMAIS total score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.04 (0.65)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.40 (0.86)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.45 (–0.68 to 3.57)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.18</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>Table note: All data are least squares mean change from baseline.

Both models compared risdiplam with best supportive care. Health-state transitions were based on assessments of motor milestones using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Module 2 for type 1 SMA, and the 32 item Motor Function Measure and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. In the type 1 model, the ERG noted that the company's approach overestimates overall survival in the best supportive care arm. It stated that the company should have applied the hazard ratio to the best supportive care group instead of applying the inverse of the hazard ratio to the risdiplam group. After technical engagement, the company added a treatment-effect plateau similar to that used in TA588. The plateau assumed patients who have had risdiplam will not reach additional motor milestones after 66 months for SMA type 1 and 26 months for SMA type 2 or 3. The ERG explained that the company's models were broadly consistent with the final model used in TA588 but there were differences in the stopping rule and caregiver assumptions (see sections 0 and 3.13).

This restricted its use to a maximum of 50 years for type 1 SMA and 30 years for types 2 and 3 SMA. The committee noted that this approach differed to the stopping criteria in TA588, which was based on clinical outcomes including repeated loss of motor function, the need for ventilation and scoliosis. Clinical advice to the company suggested that a time-based rule may be easy to implement in the NHS in England and may be preferred to the current criteria set out in TA588 because it would avoid pressure for continuous motor milestone improvement. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the current stopping rules in TA588 were problematic and put undue strain on patients and their caregivers. The clinical expert suggested that a maximum treatment duration of 50 years would be reasonable for type 1 SMA, but 30 years may not be appropriate for types 2 and 3. This is because many adults may still benefit from risdiplam and it would be unfair to stop treatment for these people. The ERG preferred not to include the company's time-based stopping rule because it was not based on any evidence. But it noted that a stopping rule based on clinical criteria may improve risdiplam's cost-effectiveness. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the stopping rule used in TA588 is challenging to implement in clinical practice. So, the committee considered that appropriate stopping criteria should be explored in collaboration with clinical and patient experts and the wider SMA community. It was aware that there is ongoing work reviewing the TA588 stopping criteria for nusinersen and agreed that this could also be relevant for risdiplam. In the absence of updated criteria from TA588, the committee concluded that the company's stopping rules may not be appropriate and it would like to see stopping rules based on clinical criteria that have been agreed with clinical and patient experts.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Utility values\" id=\"398-1-utility-values\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"utility-values\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Utility values</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger\" id=\"398-1-the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"398-1-3.12\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.12</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>After technical engagement, the company included in its base case an additional utility gain to reflect risdiplam's potential benefits in fine motor skills.

The committee was sympathetic to these arguments and noted that SUNFISH showed improvements in upper limb function at 12 months and also in the SMA independence scale (see table 1).

The company used an additive approach and assumed that caregiver health-related quality of life increased linearly with each motor milestone that was met. The ERG explained that the company's additive approach assumed that after a patient died the caregiver health-related quality of life was zero. This increased the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains for risdiplam because patients live longer. The ERG did not think this was appropriate because it assumed society places value on caregivers of surviving patients with SMA but does not for bereaved caregivers. Submissions at technical engagement from patient and professional organisations emphasised that bereavement would have a significant and sustained effect on a caregiver's health-related quality of life. After technical engagement, the ERG presented its preferred analysis and 2 scenario analyses that explored the effects of bereavement. It preferred to apply a disutility (reduction in health-related quality of life) that was linked to the health state of the patient with SMA. But in the base case, after the patient died, the caregiver utility value was assumed to return to that of the general population. In the first scenario, the ERG applied a disutility of -0.04 from Song et al. (2010) for 20 years after the patient with SMA died and in the second scenario the same disutility was applied for the maximum time horizon (90 years). The ERG cautioned that the analyses were limited because they used arbitrary assumptions and the company's model did not include caregiver ageing or survival. The committee understood that the ERG's disutility approach was consistent with TA588 and was not aware of any previous technology appraisals that used the company's preferred additive approach to model caregiver utility values. It also noted that while the guide to the methods of technology evaluation states that when relevant, direct health effects for carers can be included in analyses, it is unclear whether this extends to valuing caregiver bereavement. It recalled that SMA has a substantial effect on carers and families as well as patients and can affect multiple members of the extended family (see section 3.3). It was aware that using the ERG's preferred disutility approach substantially increased the cost-effectiveness ratios, particularly for type 1 SMA. This was because the substantial caregiver disutilities were subtracted from the patient utility values, which themselves reflect a poor quality of life. So increased survival results in a low number of QALYs, but at a high extra cost. This was less of an issue for type 2 and type 3 SMA because the additional survival is associated with higher patient utility and lower carer disutility than in the type 1 model, meaning a higher number of QALYs can be accrued. The company noted that this was counterintuitive because it made a life-extending treatment appear to be less cost effective. It also noted that using the ERG's approach meant that risdiplam was not cost effective, even when there was no cost for risdiplam. The ERG explained that the cost-effectiveness of risdiplam was related to other factors including extended overall survival and high disease management costs. Also, the committee understood that the company preferred to assume each patient with SMA would have 2.2 caregivers. However, the ERG preferred to assume 3 caregivers for patients with type 2 or 3 SMA who cannot sit because this is consistent with TA588. The committee did not accept the company's approach to caregiver utility but recognised the difficulties in valuing caregiver utility values. It noted that the ERG approach also had limitations and resulted in particularly high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for type 1 SMA. Despite accepting the logic of the ERG's modelling, it did not agree that including carer quality of life would result in fewer QALYs being accrued by carers when risdiplam extends survival.  Therefore, it would welcome suggestions for alternative approaches for valuing caregiver quality of life in this appraisal. The committee concluded that the ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with TA588 but neither the company's nor the ERG approach is ideal, so there is substantial uncertainty.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"End of life\" id=\"398-1-end-of-life\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"end-of-life\" data-heading-type=\"section\">End of life</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA\" id=\"398-1-it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"398-1-3.14\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.14</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg9\" target=\"_top\">guide to the methods of technology appraisal</a>. The company proposed that risdiplam met NICE's criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but did not make a case for meeting the criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. The committee accepted that risdiplam did not meet the end-of-life criteria in the type 2 and 3 population because, although risdiplam may provide a survival benefit, life expectancy was likely to be over 2 years. For type 1 SMA, the company noted that survival depends on the nature and extent of supportive care. This may vary by country, NHS trust, clinician, and the preferences of patients and their families. The median age of death or permanent respiratory support in published natural history studies was 9 months to 13 months. The ERG commented that mean survival in the company's model for people with type 1 SMA having best supportive care was 4.88 years but this was likely to be an overestimate because of the way the company had applied the hazard ratios in the model (see section 3.10). The committee noted that it usually prefers to assess whether this criterion is met by referring to the mean survival predicted by the model. However, it accepted the limitations of the model in this case mean that estimates from the literature are more robust. The committee recognised that the life expectancy is uncertain but considered it reasonable to accept that risdiplam could meet the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA\" id=\"398-1-it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"398-1-3.15\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.15</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Having concluded that the short life-expectancy criterion was met for type 1 SMA, the committee recalled that the long-term survival estimates for these patients are very uncertain (see section 3.9).

The committee noted that nusinersen (TA588) was considered to have met the criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but not for types 2 or 3.

People with the condition have a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, and have worsening physical disability, mobility loss and respiratory dysfunction. SMA can be grouped into 5 main types (0 to 4), based on the age of onset and the maximum motor function reached. SMA type 0, the most severe, affects babies before birth. The babies do not develop any motor skills and often survive for only a few weeks after birth. Babies with type 1 SMA are unable to sit or roll because of severe muscle weakness, which gets worse over time. The muscle weakness also affects swallowing and breathing, and typically results in death within 2 years if respiratory support is not used. In type 2 SMA, the onset of symptoms is between 7 months and 18 months. People with this condition can sit independently at diagnosis. However, progressive loss of motor function means they have a reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. In type 3 SMA, there are varying degrees of muscle weakness, which appear between 18 months and 18 years. People with this condition can have a normal lifespan, and walk or sit unaided at some point, but many lose mobility and other functions over time. Type 4 SMA is the least severe and affects adults, who may have milder motor impairment and live a normal lifespan. The clinical experts explained that type 0 and type 4 SMA are rarely diagnosed in clinical practice in the NHS in England. The patient experts explained that SMA is a progressive disorder so all patients will experience more severe symptoms over time. The committee concluded that SMA is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disorder that affects all aspects of daily life.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam\" id=\"404-1-the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"404-1-3.2\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.2</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The patient experts commented that the SMA classification system does not always reflect the full extent of the disease. The boundaries between the different SMA types are blurred and can be subjective. They also explained that it was not originally intended to define populations who were eligible for treatment. One patient expert with a child with type 3 SMA described how progressive loss of motor function has affected all daily activities and being unable to access treatments such as nusinersen has a big effect on physical and mental health. The committee understood that risdiplam's marketing authorisation includes types 1 to 3 SMA as currently defined by the SMA classification system and these definitions were also used in the clinical evidence (see section 3.5). The committee acknowledged the limitations of the current SMA classification system but concluded that it had been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families\" id=\"404-1-sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\" data-heading-type=\"section\">SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"404-1-3.3\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.3</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The clinical and patient experts explained that most people with SMA need constant support. This can include full-time care and attention, needing physical effort (such as lifting and carrying) and causing loss of sleep for patients and carers, stress, and fear about loss of abilities. One patient expert with a child with type 2 SMA described how living with the condition can put considerable strain on relationships with other family members and friends. Siblings have a restricted social circle because of the fear of respiratory infections, and often act as young carers. As well as dealing with the physical and mental stress as the condition progresses, the financial burden also increases as more supportive equipment is needed. Another patient expert with type 2 SMA described the fear of losing fine motor skills and how being unable to work would affect the whole family. All these factors have a large effect on family members' health-related quality of life. The patient experts emphasised how caring for people with SMA affects the whole family and can cause physical, mental and financial issues. The committee concluded that SMA has a substantial effect on the quality of life of patients, caregivers and their families.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Comparator\" id=\"404-1-comparator\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"comparator\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Comparator</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam\" id=\"404-1-best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"404-1-3.4\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.4</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Nusinersen is the only disease-modifying treatment currently available for SMA. The clinical and patient experts explained that many people with SMA have spinal fusion so cannot have nusinersen because it is delivered by intrathecal injection and requires access to the lower spine. They commented that an oral treatment option would be welcome and would also address several issues related to the delivery of nusinersen including the use of sedation, radiographic imaging and anxiety associated with lumbar puncture. Nusinersen is recommended in NICE's guidance TA588 through a managed access agreement. This makes nusinersen available while more data is collected. However, nusinersen is not routinely commissioned in the NHS in England. So, current treatment for many people is best supportive care. The aim is to control symptoms, maintain movement and function for as long as possible and improve quality of life. This involves a multidisciplinary approach including respiratory, gastroenterology and orthopaedic care, as well as nutritional support, physiotherapy, assistive technologies, occupational therapy and social care. However, the clinical and patient experts emphasised that these supportive treatments do not affect disease progression, so people with SMA will ultimately become dependent on their families and carers. The committee was aware of an ongoing highly specialised technology evaluation for <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-hst10026\" target=\"_top\">onasemnogene abeparvovec for treating spinal muscular atrophy type 1</a>. It was aware that this treatment was recommended in draft guidance for routine commissioning for some babies 12 months or younger with SMA type 1. However, it understood that the guidance was not final and therefore onasemnogene abeparvovec could not be included as a comparator. The NHS England commissioning expert described the potential treatment pathway if risdiplam were to be recommended as a treatment option alongside nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec. They explained that repeated treatment switching would only be expected in exceptional circumstances, related to issues such as fertility or side effects. The committee recognised that treatment options used routinely in the NHS in England are currently limited and there is an unmet need for people with SMA. It recalled that best supportive care is routinely used in clinical practice in the NHS in England. It concluded that best supportive care was the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Clinical evidence\" id=\"404-1-clinical-evidence\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"clinical-evidence\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Clinical evidence</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3\" id=\"404-1-evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"404-1-3.5\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.5</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The main clinical effectiveness evidence for risdiplam came from 2 clinical studies:</p>\r\n          <ul class=\"itemizedlist indented\">\r\n            <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n              <p>SUNFISH, which is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre (excluding UK sites), phase 2, placebo-controlled trial.

RAINBOWFISH is a phase 2, single-arm study of babies 6 weeks or younger who had been genetically diagnosed with SMA but did not have symptoms. JEWELFISH is an open-label, single-arm study for SMA types 1, 2 and 3 in people of 6 months to 60 years who had previously enrolled in the MOONFISH study or who had previously had nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec or olesoxime. The ERG considered that although SUNFISH excluded patients with type 3 SMA who could walk, this group accounts for a small proportion of SMA cases. It also noted that SUNFISH and FIREFISH excluded patients who had previous treatment (see section 3.6). The committee noted the age restrictions used in both studies. It was aware that some babies may be diagnosed with type 1 SMA when they are older than 7 months. The clinical experts explained that the study populations were generally representative of patients with SMA in the NHS in England. The committee concluded that the evidence presented for SMA types 1 to 3 was suitable for decision making.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen\" id=\"404-1-there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\" data-heading-type=\"section\">There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"404-1-3.6\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.6</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The company did not present any clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for people who have had nusinersen.

The results from FIREFISH were compared against pre-defined performance criteria, based on natural history data for patients with type 1 SMA. The results (see table 2) suggest that after 12 months of treatment with risdiplam, more patients were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds than would be expected for patients with type 1 SMA. Overall survival was 93% (90% confidence interval 82.2% to 97.1%). After technical engagement, both the company and the ERG used the company's matched adjusted indirect comparison to model the treatment effect of risdiplam compared with best supportive care for type 1 SMA. The indirect comparison showed improvements in motor function (such as sitting with and without support), ventilation-free survival and overall survival (the company considers the data to be confidential so it cannot be reported here). The company and the ERG agreed that improvements seen in both SUNFISH and FIREFISH were clinically important. The patient experts described their experiences of using risdiplam and noted improvements in motor function, lung capacity, energy levels and stamina. They explained that even very small improvements in fine motor skills and upper limb function were very important because they allow patients to maintain independence. They emphasised that although the studies showed improvements in motor function, they would also highly value a treatment that keeps the disease stable and stops it getting worse. The committee agreed that the clinical evidence showed improved motor function with risdiplam but noted that overall survival data were only available for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n      <div class=\"informaltable\">\r\n        <table frame=\"all\" border=\"1\" id=\"ID0E2F\">\r\n          <caption>\r\n            <strong>Table 1 Results from SUNFISH for SMA types 2 and 3 at 12‑month follow up</strong>\r\n          </caption>\r\n          <thead>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Outcome</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Risdiplam n=120 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Placebo n=60 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Difference, risdiplam minus placebo (95% CI)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>p-value</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </thead>\r\n          <tbody>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>MFM-32 total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.36 (0.38)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.19 (0.52) </p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.55 (0.30 to 2.81)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02*, 0.02**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>HFMSE total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.95 (0.33)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.37 (0.46)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.58 (–0.53 to 1.69)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.30**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>RULM total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.61 (0.31)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02 (0.43)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.59 (0.55 to 2.62)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.05*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Caregiver-reported SMAIS score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.65 (0.50)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.91 (0.67)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>2.55 (0.93 to 4.17)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Patient-reported SMAIS total score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.04 (0.65)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.40 (0.86)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.45 (–0.68 to 3.57)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.18</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>Table note: All data are least squares mean change from baseline.

Both models compared risdiplam with best supportive care. Health-state transitions were based on assessments of motor milestones using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Module 2 for type 1 SMA, and the 32 item Motor Function Measure and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. In the type 1 model, the ERG noted that the company's approach overestimates overall survival in the best supportive care arm. It stated that the company should have applied the hazard ratio to the best supportive care group instead of applying the inverse of the hazard ratio to the risdiplam group. After technical engagement, the company added a treatment-effect plateau similar to that used in TA588. The plateau assumed patients who have had risdiplam will not reach additional motor milestones after 66 months for SMA type 1 and 26 months for SMA type 2 or 3. The ERG explained that the company's models were broadly consistent with the final model used in TA588 but there were differences in the stopping rule and caregiver assumptions (see sections 0 and 3.13).

This restricted its use to a maximum of 50 years for type 1 SMA and 30 years for types 2 and 3 SMA. The committee noted that this approach differed to the stopping criteria in TA588, which was based on clinical outcomes including repeated loss of motor function, the need for ventilation and scoliosis. Clinical advice to the company suggested that a time-based rule may be easy to implement in the NHS in England and may be preferred to the current criteria set out in TA588 because it would avoid pressure for continuous motor milestone improvement. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the current stopping rules in TA588 were problematic and put undue strain on patients and their caregivers. The clinical expert suggested that a maximum treatment duration of 50 years would be reasonable for type 1 SMA, but 30 years may not be appropriate for types 2 and 3. This is because many adults may still benefit from risdiplam and it would be unfair to stop treatment for these people. The ERG preferred not to include the company's time-based stopping rule because it was not based on any evidence. But it noted that a stopping rule based on clinical criteria may improve risdiplam's cost-effectiveness. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the stopping rule used in TA588 is challenging to implement in clinical practice. So, the committee considered that appropriate stopping criteria should be explored in collaboration with clinical and patient experts and the wider SMA community. It was aware that there is ongoing work reviewing the TA588 stopping criteria for nusinersen and agreed that this could also be relevant for risdiplam. In the absence of updated criteria from TA588, the committee concluded that the company's stopping rules may not be appropriate and it would like to see stopping rules based on clinical criteria that have been agreed with clinical and patient experts.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Utility values\" id=\"404-1-utility-values\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"utility-values\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Utility values</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger\" id=\"404-1-the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"404-1-3.12\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.12</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>After technical engagement, the company included in its base case an additional utility gain to reflect risdiplam's potential benefits in fine motor skills.

The committee was sympathetic to these arguments and noted that SUNFISH showed improvements in upper limb function at 12 months and also in the SMA independence scale (see table 1).

The company used an additive approach and assumed that caregiver health-related quality of life increased linearly with each motor milestone that was met. The ERG explained that the company's additive approach assumed that after a patient died the caregiver health-related quality of life was zero. This increased the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains for risdiplam because patients live longer. The ERG did not think this was appropriate because it assumed society places value on caregivers of surviving patients with SMA but does not for bereaved caregivers. Submissions at technical engagement from patient and professional organisations emphasised that bereavement would have a significant and sustained effect on a caregiver's health-related quality of life. After technical engagement, the ERG presented its preferred analysis and 2 scenario analyses that explored the effects of bereavement. It preferred to apply a disutility (reduction in health-related quality of life) that was linked to the health state of the patient with SMA. But in the base case, after the patient died, the caregiver utility value was assumed to return to that of the general population. In the first scenario, the ERG applied a disutility of -0.04 from Song et al. (2010) for 20 years after the patient with SMA died and in the second scenario the same disutility was applied for the maximum time horizon (90 years). The ERG cautioned that the analyses were limited because they used arbitrary assumptions and the company's model did not include caregiver ageing or survival. The committee understood that the ERG's disutility approach was consistent with TA588 and was not aware of any previous technology appraisals that used the company's preferred additive approach to model caregiver utility values. It also noted that while the guide to the methods of technology evaluation states that when relevant, direct health effects for carers can be included in analyses, it is unclear whether this extends to valuing caregiver bereavement. It recalled that SMA has a substantial effect on carers and families as well as patients and can affect multiple members of the extended family (see section 3.3). It was aware that using the ERG's preferred disutility approach substantially increased the cost-effectiveness ratios, particularly for type 1 SMA. This was because the substantial caregiver disutilities were subtracted from the patient utility values, which themselves reflect a poor quality of life. So increased survival results in a low number of QALYs, but at a high extra cost. This was less of an issue for type 2 and type 3 SMA because the additional survival is associated with higher patient utility and lower carer disutility than in the type 1 model, meaning a higher number of QALYs can be accrued. The company noted that this was counterintuitive because it made a life-extending treatment appear to be less cost effective. It also noted that using the ERG's approach meant that risdiplam was not cost effective, even when there was no cost for risdiplam. The ERG explained that the cost-effectiveness of risdiplam was related to other factors including extended overall survival and high disease management costs. Also, the committee understood that the company preferred to assume each patient with SMA would have 2.2 caregivers. However, the ERG preferred to assume 3 caregivers for patients with type 2 or 3 SMA who cannot sit because this is consistent with TA588. The committee did not accept the company's approach to caregiver utility but recognised the difficulties in valuing caregiver utility values. It noted that the ERG approach also had limitations and resulted in particularly high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for type 1 SMA. Despite accepting the logic of the ERG's modelling, it did not agree that including carer quality of life would result in fewer QALYs being accrued by carers when risdiplam extends survival.  Therefore, it would welcome suggestions for alternative approaches for valuing caregiver quality of life in this appraisal. The committee concluded that the ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with TA588 but neither the company's nor the ERG approach is ideal, so there is substantial uncertainty.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"End of life\" id=\"404-1-end-of-life\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"end-of-life\" data-heading-type=\"section\">End of life</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA\" id=\"404-1-it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"404-1-3.14\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.14</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg9\" target=\"_top\">guide to the methods of technology appraisal</a>. The company proposed that risdiplam met NICE's criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but did not make a case for meeting the criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. The committee accepted that risdiplam did not meet the end-of-life criteria in the type 2 and 3 population because, although risdiplam may provide a survival benefit, life expectancy was likely to be over 2 years. For type 1 SMA, the company noted that survival depends on the nature and extent of supportive care. This may vary by country, NHS trust, clinician, and the preferences of patients and their families. The median age of death or permanent respiratory support in published natural history studies was 9 months to 13 months. The ERG commented that mean survival in the company's model for people with type 1 SMA having best supportive care was 4.88 years but this was likely to be an overestimate because of the way the company had applied the hazard ratios in the model (see section 3.10). The committee noted that it usually prefers to assess whether this criterion is met by referring to the mean survival predicted by the model. However, it accepted the limitations of the model in this case mean that estimates from the literature are more robust. The committee recognised that the life expectancy is uncertain but considered it reasonable to accept that risdiplam could meet the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA\" id=\"404-1-it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"404-1-3.15\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.15</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Having concluded that the short life-expectancy criterion was met for type 1 SMA, the committee recalled that the long-term survival estimates for these patients are very uncertain (see section 3.9).

The committee noted that nusinersen (TA588) was considered to have met the criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but not for types 2 or 3.

People with the condition have a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, and have worsening physical disability, mobility loss and respiratory dysfunction. SMA can be grouped into 5 main types (0 to 4), based on the age of onset and the maximum motor function reached. SMA type 0, the most severe, affects babies before birth. The babies do not develop any motor skills and often survive for only a few weeks after birth. Babies with type 1 SMA are unable to sit or roll because of severe muscle weakness, which gets worse over time. The muscle weakness also affects swallowing and breathing, and typically results in death within 2 years if respiratory support is not used. In type 2 SMA, the onset of symptoms is between 7 months and 18 months. People with this condition can sit independently at diagnosis. However, progressive loss of motor function means they have a reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. In type 3 SMA, there are varying degrees of muscle weakness, which appear between 18 months and 18 years. People with this condition can have a normal lifespan, and walk or sit unaided at some point, but many lose mobility and other functions over time. Type 4 SMA is the least severe and affects adults, who may have milder motor impairment and live a normal lifespan. The clinical experts explained that type 0 and type 4 SMA are rarely diagnosed in clinical practice in the NHS in England. The patient experts explained that SMA is a progressive disorder so all patients will experience more severe symptoms over time. The committee concluded that SMA is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disorder that affects all aspects of daily life.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam\" id=\"405-1-the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"405-1-3.2\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.2</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The patient experts commented that the SMA classification system does not always reflect the full extent of the disease. The boundaries between the different SMA types are blurred and can be subjective. They also explained that it was not originally intended to define populations who were eligible for treatment. One patient expert with a child with type 3 SMA described how progressive loss of motor function has affected all daily activities and being unable to access treatments such as nusinersen has a big effect on physical and mental health. The committee understood that risdiplam's marketing authorisation includes types 1 to 3 SMA as currently defined by the SMA classification system and these definitions were also used in the clinical evidence (see section 3.5). The committee acknowledged the limitations of the current SMA classification system but concluded that it had been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families\" id=\"405-1-sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\" data-heading-type=\"section\">SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"405-1-3.3\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.3</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The clinical and patient experts explained that most people with SMA need constant support. This can include full-time care and attention, needing physical effort (such as lifting and carrying) and causing loss of sleep for patients and carers, stress, and fear about loss of abilities. One patient expert with a child with type 2 SMA described how living with the condition can put considerable strain on relationships with other family members and friends. Siblings have a restricted social circle because of the fear of respiratory infections, and often act as young carers. As well as dealing with the physical and mental stress as the condition progresses, the financial burden also increases as more supportive equipment is needed. Another patient expert with type 2 SMA described the fear of losing fine motor skills and how being unable to work would affect the whole family. All these factors have a large effect on family members' health-related quality of life. The patient experts emphasised how caring for people with SMA affects the whole family and can cause physical, mental and financial issues. The committee concluded that SMA has a substantial effect on the quality of life of patients, caregivers and their families.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Comparator\" id=\"405-1-comparator\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"comparator\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Comparator</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam\" id=\"405-1-best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"405-1-3.4\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.4</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Nusinersen is the only disease-modifying treatment currently available for SMA. The clinical and patient experts explained that many people with SMA have spinal fusion so cannot have nusinersen because it is delivered by intrathecal injection and requires access to the lower spine. They commented that an oral treatment option would be welcome and would also address several issues related to the delivery of nusinersen including the use of sedation, radiographic imaging and anxiety associated with lumbar puncture. Nusinersen is recommended in NICE's guidance TA588 through a managed access agreement. This makes nusinersen available while more data is collected. However, nusinersen is not routinely commissioned in the NHS in England. So, current treatment for many people is best supportive care. The aim is to control symptoms, maintain movement and function for as long as possible and improve quality of life. This involves a multidisciplinary approach including respiratory, gastroenterology and orthopaedic care, as well as nutritional support, physiotherapy, assistive technologies, occupational therapy and social care. However, the clinical and patient experts emphasised that these supportive treatments do not affect disease progression, so people with SMA will ultimately become dependent on their families and carers. The committee was aware of an ongoing highly specialised technology evaluation for <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-hst10026\" target=\"_top\">onasemnogene abeparvovec for treating spinal muscular atrophy type 1</a>. It was aware that this treatment was recommended in draft guidance for routine commissioning for some babies 12 months or younger with SMA type 1. However, it understood that the guidance was not final and therefore onasemnogene abeparvovec could not be included as a comparator. The NHS England commissioning expert described the potential treatment pathway if risdiplam were to be recommended as a treatment option alongside nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec. They explained that repeated treatment switching would only be expected in exceptional circumstances, related to issues such as fertility or side effects. The committee recognised that treatment options used routinely in the NHS in England are currently limited and there is an unmet need for people with SMA. It recalled that best supportive care is routinely used in clinical practice in the NHS in England. It concluded that best supportive care was the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Clinical evidence\" id=\"405-1-clinical-evidence\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"clinical-evidence\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Clinical evidence</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3\" id=\"405-1-evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"405-1-3.5\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.5</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The main clinical effectiveness evidence for risdiplam came from 2 clinical studies:</p>\r\n          <ul class=\"itemizedlist indented\">\r\n            <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n              <p>SUNFISH, which is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre (excluding UK sites), phase 2, placebo-controlled trial.

RAINBOWFISH is a phase 2, single-arm study of babies 6 weeks or younger who had been genetically diagnosed with SMA but did not have symptoms. JEWELFISH is an open-label, single-arm study for SMA types 1, 2 and 3 in people of 6 months to 60 years who had previously enrolled in the MOONFISH study or who had previously had nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec or olesoxime. The ERG considered that although SUNFISH excluded patients with type 3 SMA who could walk, this group accounts for a small proportion of SMA cases. It also noted that SUNFISH and FIREFISH excluded patients who had previous treatment (see section 3.6). The committee noted the age restrictions used in both studies. It was aware that some babies may be diagnosed with type 1 SMA when they are older than 7 months. The clinical experts explained that the study populations were generally representative of patients with SMA in the NHS in England. The committee concluded that the evidence presented for SMA types 1 to 3 was suitable for decision making.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen\" id=\"405-1-there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\" data-heading-type=\"section\">There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"405-1-3.6\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.6</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The company did not present any clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for people who have had nusinersen.

The results from FIREFISH were compared against pre-defined performance criteria, based on natural history data for patients with type 1 SMA. The results (see table 2) suggest that after 12 months of treatment with risdiplam, more patients were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds than would be expected for patients with type 1 SMA. Overall survival was 93% (90% confidence interval 82.2% to 97.1%). After technical engagement, both the company and the ERG used the company's matched adjusted indirect comparison to model the treatment effect of risdiplam compared with best supportive care for type 1 SMA. The indirect comparison showed improvements in motor function (such as sitting with and without support), ventilation-free survival and overall survival (the company considers the data to be confidential so it cannot be reported here). The company and the ERG agreed that improvements seen in both SUNFISH and FIREFISH were clinically important. The patient experts described their experiences of using risdiplam and noted improvements in motor function, lung capacity, energy levels and stamina. They explained that even very small improvements in fine motor skills and upper limb function were very important because they allow patients to maintain independence. They emphasised that although the studies showed improvements in motor function, they would also highly value a treatment that keeps the disease stable and stops it getting worse. The committee agreed that the clinical evidence showed improved motor function with risdiplam but noted that overall survival data were only available for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n      <div class=\"informaltable\">\r\n        <table frame=\"all\" border=\"1\" id=\"ID0E2F\">\r\n          <caption>\r\n            <strong>Table 1 Results from SUNFISH for SMA types 2 and 3 at 12‑month follow up</strong>\r\n          </caption>\r\n          <thead>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Outcome</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Risdiplam n=120 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Placebo n=60 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Difference, risdiplam minus placebo (95% CI)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>p-value</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </thead>\r\n          <tbody>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>MFM-32 total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.36 (0.38)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.19 (0.52) </p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.55 (0.30 to 2.81)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02*, 0.02**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>HFMSE total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.95 (0.33)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.37 (0.46)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.58 (–0.53 to 1.69)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.30**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>RULM total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.61 (0.31)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02 (0.43)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.59 (0.55 to 2.62)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.05*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Caregiver-reported SMAIS score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.65 (0.50)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.91 (0.67)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>2.55 (0.93 to 4.17)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Patient-reported SMAIS total score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.04 (0.65)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.40 (0.86)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.45 (–0.68 to 3.57)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.18</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>Table note: All data are least squares mean change from baseline.

Both models compared risdiplam with best supportive care. Health-state transitions were based on assessments of motor milestones using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Module 2 for type 1 SMA, and the 32 item Motor Function Measure and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. In the type 1 model, the ERG noted that the company's approach overestimates overall survival in the best supportive care arm. It stated that the company should have applied the hazard ratio to the best supportive care group instead of applying the inverse of the hazard ratio to the risdiplam group. After technical engagement, the company added a treatment-effect plateau similar to that used in TA588. The plateau assumed patients who have had risdiplam will not reach additional motor milestones after 66 months for SMA type 1 and 26 months for SMA type 2 or 3. The ERG explained that the company's models were broadly consistent with the final model used in TA588 but there were differences in the stopping rule and caregiver assumptions (see sections 0 and 3.13).

This restricted its use to a maximum of 50 years for type 1 SMA and 30 years for types 2 and 3 SMA. The committee noted that this approach differed to the stopping criteria in TA588, which was based on clinical outcomes including repeated loss of motor function, the need for ventilation and scoliosis. Clinical advice to the company suggested that a time-based rule may be easy to implement in the NHS in England and may be preferred to the current criteria set out in TA588 because it would avoid pressure for continuous motor milestone improvement. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the current stopping rules in TA588 were problematic and put undue strain on patients and their caregivers. The clinical expert suggested that a maximum treatment duration of 50 years would be reasonable for type 1 SMA, but 30 years may not be appropriate for types 2 and 3. This is because many adults may still benefit from risdiplam and it would be unfair to stop treatment for these people. The ERG preferred not to include the company's time-based stopping rule because it was not based on any evidence. But it noted that a stopping rule based on clinical criteria may improve risdiplam's cost-effectiveness. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the stopping rule used in TA588 is challenging to implement in clinical practice. So, the committee considered that appropriate stopping criteria should be explored in collaboration with clinical and patient experts and the wider SMA community. It was aware that there is ongoing work reviewing the TA588 stopping criteria for nusinersen and agreed that this could also be relevant for risdiplam. In the absence of updated criteria from TA588, the committee concluded that the company's stopping rules may not be appropriate and it would like to see stopping rules based on clinical criteria that have been agreed with clinical and patient experts.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Utility values\" id=\"405-1-utility-values\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"utility-values\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Utility values</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger\" id=\"405-1-the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"405-1-3.12\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.12</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>After technical engagement, the company included in its base case an additional utility gain to reflect risdiplam's potential benefits in fine motor skills.

The committee was sympathetic to these arguments and noted that SUNFISH showed improvements in upper limb function at 12 months and also in the SMA independence scale (see table 1).

The company used an additive approach and assumed that caregiver health-related quality of life increased linearly with each motor milestone that was met. The ERG explained that the company's additive approach assumed that after a patient died the caregiver health-related quality of life was zero. This increased the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains for risdiplam because patients live longer. The ERG did not think this was appropriate because it assumed society places value on caregivers of surviving patients with SMA but does not for bereaved caregivers. Submissions at technical engagement from patient and professional organisations emphasised that bereavement would have a significant and sustained effect on a caregiver's health-related quality of life. After technical engagement, the ERG presented its preferred analysis and 2 scenario analyses that explored the effects of bereavement. It preferred to apply a disutility (reduction in health-related quality of life) that was linked to the health state of the patient with SMA. But in the base case, after the patient died, the caregiver utility value was assumed to return to that of the general population. In the first scenario, the ERG applied a disutility of -0.04 from Song et al. (2010) for 20 years after the patient with SMA died and in the second scenario the same disutility was applied for the maximum time horizon (90 years). The ERG cautioned that the analyses were limited because they used arbitrary assumptions and the company's model did not include caregiver ageing or survival. The committee understood that the ERG's disutility approach was consistent with TA588 and was not aware of any previous technology appraisals that used the company's preferred additive approach to model caregiver utility values. It also noted that while the guide to the methods of technology evaluation states that when relevant, direct health effects for carers can be included in analyses, it is unclear whether this extends to valuing caregiver bereavement. It recalled that SMA has a substantial effect on carers and families as well as patients and can affect multiple members of the extended family (see section 3.3). It was aware that using the ERG's preferred disutility approach substantially increased the cost-effectiveness ratios, particularly for type 1 SMA. This was because the substantial caregiver disutilities were subtracted from the patient utility values, which themselves reflect a poor quality of life. So increased survival results in a low number of QALYs, but at a high extra cost. This was less of an issue for type 2 and type 3 SMA because the additional survival is associated with higher patient utility and lower carer disutility than in the type 1 model, meaning a higher number of QALYs can be accrued. The company noted that this was counterintuitive because it made a life-extending treatment appear to be less cost effective. It also noted that using the ERG's approach meant that risdiplam was not cost effective, even when there was no cost for risdiplam. The ERG explained that the cost-effectiveness of risdiplam was related to other factors including extended overall survival and high disease management costs. Also, the committee understood that the company preferred to assume each patient with SMA would have 2.2 caregivers. However, the ERG preferred to assume 3 caregivers for patients with type 2 or 3 SMA who cannot sit because this is consistent with TA588. The committee did not accept the company's approach to caregiver utility but recognised the difficulties in valuing caregiver utility values. It noted that the ERG approach also had limitations and resulted in particularly high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for type 1 SMA. Despite accepting the logic of the ERG's modelling, it did not agree that including carer quality of life would result in fewer QALYs being accrued by carers when risdiplam extends survival.  Therefore, it would welcome suggestions for alternative approaches for valuing caregiver quality of life in this appraisal. The committee concluded that the ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with TA588 but neither the company's nor the ERG approach is ideal, so there is substantial uncertainty.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"End of life\" id=\"405-1-end-of-life\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"end-of-life\" data-heading-type=\"section\">End of life</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA\" id=\"405-1-it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"405-1-3.14\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.14</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg9\" target=\"_top\">guide to the methods of technology appraisal</a>. The company proposed that risdiplam met NICE's criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but did not make a case for meeting the criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. The committee accepted that risdiplam did not meet the end-of-life criteria in the type 2 and 3 population because, although risdiplam may provide a survival benefit, life expectancy was likely to be over 2 years. For type 1 SMA, the company noted that survival depends on the nature and extent of supportive care. This may vary by country, NHS trust, clinician, and the preferences of patients and their families. The median age of death or permanent respiratory support in published natural history studies was 9 months to 13 months. The ERG commented that mean survival in the company's model for people with type 1 SMA having best supportive care was 4.88 years but this was likely to be an overestimate because of the way the company had applied the hazard ratios in the model (see section 3.10). The committee noted that it usually prefers to assess whether this criterion is met by referring to the mean survival predicted by the model. However, it accepted the limitations of the model in this case mean that estimates from the literature are more robust. The committee recognised that the life expectancy is uncertain but considered it reasonable to accept that risdiplam could meet the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA\" id=\"405-1-it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"405-1-3.15\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.15</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Having concluded that the short life-expectancy criterion was met for type 1 SMA, the committee recalled that the long-term survival estimates for these patients are very uncertain (see section 3.9).

The committee noted that nusinersen (TA588) was considered to have met the criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but not for types 2 or 3.

People with the condition have a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, and have worsening physical disability, mobility loss and respiratory dysfunction. SMA can be grouped into 5 main types (0 to 4), based on the age of onset and the maximum motor function reached. SMA type 0, the most severe, affects babies before birth. The babies do not develop any motor skills and often survive for only a few weeks after birth. Babies with type 1 SMA are unable to sit or roll because of severe muscle weakness, which gets worse over time. The muscle weakness also affects swallowing and breathing, and typically results in death within 2 years if respiratory support is not used. In type 2 SMA, the onset of symptoms is between 7 months and 18 months. People with this condition can sit independently at diagnosis. However, progressive loss of motor function means they have a reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. In type 3 SMA, there are varying degrees of muscle weakness, which appear between 18 months and 18 years. People with this condition can have a normal lifespan, and walk or sit unaided at some point, but many lose mobility and other functions over time. Type 4 SMA is the least severe and affects adults, who may have milder motor impairment and live a normal lifespan. The clinical experts explained that type 0 and type 4 SMA are rarely diagnosed in clinical practice in the NHS in England. The patient experts explained that SMA is a progressive disorder so all patients will experience more severe symptoms over time. The committee concluded that SMA is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disorder that affects all aspects of daily life.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam\" id=\"406-1-the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"406-1-3.2\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.2</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The patient experts commented that the SMA classification system does not always reflect the full extent of the disease. The boundaries between the different SMA types are blurred and can be subjective. They also explained that it was not originally intended to define populations who were eligible for treatment. One patient expert with a child with type 3 SMA described how progressive loss of motor function has affected all daily activities and being unable to access treatments such as nusinersen has a big effect on physical and mental health. The committee understood that risdiplam's marketing authorisation includes types 1 to 3 SMA as currently defined by the SMA classification system and these definitions were also used in the clinical evidence (see section 3.5). The committee acknowledged the limitations of the current SMA classification system but concluded that it had been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families\" id=\"406-1-sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\" data-heading-type=\"section\">SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"406-1-3.3\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.3</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The clinical and patient experts explained that most people with SMA need constant support. This can include full-time care and attention, needing physical effort (such as lifting and carrying) and causing loss of sleep for patients and carers, stress, and fear about loss of abilities. One patient expert with a child with type 2 SMA described how living with the condition can put considerable strain on relationships with other family members and friends. Siblings have a restricted social circle because of the fear of respiratory infections, and often act as young carers. As well as dealing with the physical and mental stress as the condition progresses, the financial burden also increases as more supportive equipment is needed. Another patient expert with type 2 SMA described the fear of losing fine motor skills and how being unable to work would affect the whole family. All these factors have a large effect on family members' health-related quality of life. The patient experts emphasised how caring for people with SMA affects the whole family and can cause physical, mental and financial issues. The committee concluded that SMA has a substantial effect on the quality of life of patients, caregivers and their families.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Comparator\" id=\"406-1-comparator\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"comparator\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Comparator</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam\" id=\"406-1-best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"406-1-3.4\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.4</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Nusinersen is the only disease-modifying treatment currently available for SMA. The clinical and patient experts explained that many people with SMA have spinal fusion so cannot have nusinersen because it is delivered by intrathecal injection and requires access to the lower spine. They commented that an oral treatment option would be welcome and would also address several issues related to the delivery of nusinersen including the use of sedation, radiographic imaging and anxiety associated with lumbar puncture. Nusinersen is recommended in NICE's guidance TA588 through a managed access agreement. This makes nusinersen available while more data is collected. However, nusinersen is not routinely commissioned in the NHS in England. So, current treatment for many people is best supportive care. The aim is to control symptoms, maintain movement and function for as long as possible and improve quality of life. This involves a multidisciplinary approach including respiratory, gastroenterology and orthopaedic care, as well as nutritional support, physiotherapy, assistive technologies, occupational therapy and social care. However, the clinical and patient experts emphasised that these supportive treatments do not affect disease progression, so people with SMA will ultimately become dependent on their families and carers. The committee was aware of an ongoing highly specialised technology evaluation for <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-hst10026\" target=\"_top\">onasemnogene abeparvovec for treating spinal muscular atrophy type 1</a>. It was aware that this treatment was recommended in draft guidance for routine commissioning for some babies 12 months or younger with SMA type 1. However, it understood that the guidance was not final and therefore onasemnogene abeparvovec could not be included as a comparator. The NHS England commissioning expert described the potential treatment pathway if risdiplam were to be recommended as a treatment option alongside nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec. They explained that repeated treatment switching would only be expected in exceptional circumstances, related to issues such as fertility or side effects. The committee recognised that treatment options used routinely in the NHS in England are currently limited and there is an unmet need for people with SMA. It recalled that best supportive care is routinely used in clinical practice in the NHS in England. It concluded that best supportive care was the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Clinical evidence\" id=\"406-1-clinical-evidence\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"clinical-evidence\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Clinical evidence</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3\" id=\"406-1-evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"406-1-3.5\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.5</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The main clinical effectiveness evidence for risdiplam came from 2 clinical studies:</p>\r\n          <ul class=\"itemizedlist indented\">\r\n            <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n              <p>SUNFISH, which is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre (excluding UK sites), phase 2, placebo-controlled trial.

RAINBOWFISH is a phase 2, single-arm study of babies 6 weeks or younger who had been genetically diagnosed with SMA but did not have symptoms. JEWELFISH is an open-label, single-arm study for SMA types 1, 2 and 3 in people of 6 months to 60 years who had previously enrolled in the MOONFISH study or who had previously had nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec or olesoxime. The ERG considered that although SUNFISH excluded patients with type 3 SMA who could walk, this group accounts for a small proportion of SMA cases. It also noted that SUNFISH and FIREFISH excluded patients who had previous treatment (see section 3.6). The committee noted the age restrictions used in both studies. It was aware that some babies may be diagnosed with type 1 SMA when they are older than 7 months. The clinical experts explained that the study populations were generally representative of patients with SMA in the NHS in England. The committee concluded that the evidence presented for SMA types 1 to 3 was suitable for decision making.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen\" id=\"406-1-there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\" data-heading-type=\"section\">There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"406-1-3.6\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.6</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The company did not present any clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for people who have had nusinersen.

The results from FIREFISH were compared against pre-defined performance criteria, based on natural history data for patients with type 1 SMA. The results (see table 2) suggest that after 12 months of treatment with risdiplam, more patients were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds than would be expected for patients with type 1 SMA. Overall survival was 93% (90% confidence interval 82.2% to 97.1%). After technical engagement, both the company and the ERG used the company's matched adjusted indirect comparison to model the treatment effect of risdiplam compared with best supportive care for type 1 SMA. The indirect comparison showed improvements in motor function (such as sitting with and without support), ventilation-free survival and overall survival (the company considers the data to be confidential so it cannot be reported here). The company and the ERG agreed that improvements seen in both SUNFISH and FIREFISH were clinically important. The patient experts described their experiences of using risdiplam and noted improvements in motor function, lung capacity, energy levels and stamina. They explained that even very small improvements in fine motor skills and upper limb function were very important because they allow patients to maintain independence. They emphasised that although the studies showed improvements in motor function, they would also highly value a treatment that keeps the disease stable and stops it getting worse. The committee agreed that the clinical evidence showed improved motor function with risdiplam but noted that overall survival data were only available for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n      <div class=\"informaltable\">\r\n        <table frame=\"all\" border=\"1\" id=\"ID0E2F\">\r\n          <caption>\r\n            <strong>Table 1 Results from SUNFISH for SMA types 2 and 3 at 12‑month follow up</strong>\r\n          </caption>\r\n          <thead>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Outcome</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Risdiplam n=120 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Placebo n=60 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Difference, risdiplam minus placebo (95% CI)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>p-value</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </thead>\r\n          <tbody>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>MFM-32 total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.36 (0.38)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.19 (0.52) </p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.55 (0.30 to 2.81)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02*, 0.02**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>HFMSE total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.95 (0.33)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.37 (0.46)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.58 (–0.53 to 1.69)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.30**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>RULM total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.61 (0.31)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02 (0.43)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.59 (0.55 to 2.62)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.05*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Caregiver-reported SMAIS score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.65 (0.50)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.91 (0.67)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>2.55 (0.93 to 4.17)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Patient-reported SMAIS total score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.04 (0.65)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.40 (0.86)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.45 (–0.68 to 3.57)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.18</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>Table note: All data are least squares mean change from baseline.

Both models compared risdiplam with best supportive care. Health-state transitions were based on assessments of motor milestones using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Module 2 for type 1 SMA, and the 32 item Motor Function Measure and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. In the type 1 model, the ERG noted that the company's approach overestimates overall survival in the best supportive care arm. It stated that the company should have applied the hazard ratio to the best supportive care group instead of applying the inverse of the hazard ratio to the risdiplam group. After technical engagement, the company added a treatment-effect plateau similar to that used in TA588. The plateau assumed patients who have had risdiplam will not reach additional motor milestones after 66 months for SMA type 1 and 26 months for SMA type 2 or 3. The ERG explained that the company's models were broadly consistent with the final model used in TA588 but there were differences in the stopping rule and caregiver assumptions (see sections 0 and 3.13).

This restricted its use to a maximum of 50 years for type 1 SMA and 30 years for types 2 and 3 SMA. The committee noted that this approach differed to the stopping criteria in TA588, which was based on clinical outcomes including repeated loss of motor function, the need for ventilation and scoliosis. Clinical advice to the company suggested that a time-based rule may be easy to implement in the NHS in England and may be preferred to the current criteria set out in TA588 because it would avoid pressure for continuous motor milestone improvement. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the current stopping rules in TA588 were problematic and put undue strain on patients and their caregivers. The clinical expert suggested that a maximum treatment duration of 50 years would be reasonable for type 1 SMA, but 30 years may not be appropriate for types 2 and 3. This is because many adults may still benefit from risdiplam and it would be unfair to stop treatment for these people. The ERG preferred not to include the company's time-based stopping rule because it was not based on any evidence. But it noted that a stopping rule based on clinical criteria may improve risdiplam's cost-effectiveness. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the stopping rule used in TA588 is challenging to implement in clinical practice. So, the committee considered that appropriate stopping criteria should be explored in collaboration with clinical and patient experts and the wider SMA community. It was aware that there is ongoing work reviewing the TA588 stopping criteria for nusinersen and agreed that this could also be relevant for risdiplam. In the absence of updated criteria from TA588, the committee concluded that the company's stopping rules may not be appropriate and it would like to see stopping rules based on clinical criteria that have been agreed with clinical and patient experts.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Utility values\" id=\"406-1-utility-values\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"utility-values\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Utility values</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger\" id=\"406-1-the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"406-1-3.12\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.12</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>After technical engagement, the company included in its base case an additional utility gain to reflect risdiplam's potential benefits in fine motor skills.

The committee was sympathetic to these arguments and noted that SUNFISH showed improvements in upper limb function at 12 months and also in the SMA independence scale (see table 1).

The company used an additive approach and assumed that caregiver health-related quality of life increased linearly with each motor milestone that was met. The ERG explained that the company's additive approach assumed that after a patient died the caregiver health-related quality of life was zero. This increased the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains for risdiplam because patients live longer. The ERG did not think this was appropriate because it assumed society places value on caregivers of surviving patients with SMA but does not for bereaved caregivers. Submissions at technical engagement from patient and professional organisations emphasised that bereavement would have a significant and sustained effect on a caregiver's health-related quality of life. After technical engagement, the ERG presented its preferred analysis and 2 scenario analyses that explored the effects of bereavement. It preferred to apply a disutility (reduction in health-related quality of life) that was linked to the health state of the patient with SMA. But in the base case, after the patient died, the caregiver utility value was assumed to return to that of the general population. In the first scenario, the ERG applied a disutility of -0.04 from Song et al. (2010) for 20 years after the patient with SMA died and in the second scenario the same disutility was applied for the maximum time horizon (90 years). The ERG cautioned that the analyses were limited because they used arbitrary assumptions and the company's model did not include caregiver ageing or survival. The committee understood that the ERG's disutility approach was consistent with TA588 and was not aware of any previous technology appraisals that used the company's preferred additive approach to model caregiver utility values. It also noted that while the guide to the methods of technology evaluation states that when relevant, direct health effects for carers can be included in analyses, it is unclear whether this extends to valuing caregiver bereavement. It recalled that SMA has a substantial effect on carers and families as well as patients and can affect multiple members of the extended family (see section 3.3). It was aware that using the ERG's preferred disutility approach substantially increased the cost-effectiveness ratios, particularly for type 1 SMA. This was because the substantial caregiver disutilities were subtracted from the patient utility values, which themselves reflect a poor quality of life. So increased survival results in a low number of QALYs, but at a high extra cost. This was less of an issue for type 2 and type 3 SMA because the additional survival is associated with higher patient utility and lower carer disutility than in the type 1 model, meaning a higher number of QALYs can be accrued. The company noted that this was counterintuitive because it made a life-extending treatment appear to be less cost effective. It also noted that using the ERG's approach meant that risdiplam was not cost effective, even when there was no cost for risdiplam. The ERG explained that the cost-effectiveness of risdiplam was related to other factors including extended overall survival and high disease management costs. Also, the committee understood that the company preferred to assume each patient with SMA would have 2.2 caregivers. However, the ERG preferred to assume 3 caregivers for patients with type 2 or 3 SMA who cannot sit because this is consistent with TA588. The committee did not accept the company's approach to caregiver utility but recognised the difficulties in valuing caregiver utility values. It noted that the ERG approach also had limitations and resulted in particularly high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for type 1 SMA. Despite accepting the logic of the ERG's modelling, it did not agree that including carer quality of life would result in fewer QALYs being accrued by carers when risdiplam extends survival.  Therefore, it would welcome suggestions for alternative approaches for valuing caregiver quality of life in this appraisal. The committee concluded that the ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with TA588 but neither the company's nor the ERG approach is ideal, so there is substantial uncertainty.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"End of life\" id=\"406-1-end-of-life\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"end-of-life\" data-heading-type=\"section\">End of life</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA\" id=\"406-1-it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"406-1-3.14\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.14</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg9\" target=\"_top\">guide to the methods of technology appraisal</a>. The company proposed that risdiplam met NICE's criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but did not make a case for meeting the criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. The committee accepted that risdiplam did not meet the end-of-life criteria in the type 2 and 3 population because, although risdiplam may provide a survival benefit, life expectancy was likely to be over 2 years. For type 1 SMA, the company noted that survival depends on the nature and extent of supportive care. This may vary by country, NHS trust, clinician, and the preferences of patients and their families. The median age of death or permanent respiratory support in published natural history studies was 9 months to 13 months. The ERG commented that mean survival in the company's model for people with type 1 SMA having best supportive care was 4.88 years but this was likely to be an overestimate because of the way the company had applied the hazard ratios in the model (see section 3.10). The committee noted that it usually prefers to assess whether this criterion is met by referring to the mean survival predicted by the model. However, it accepted the limitations of the model in this case mean that estimates from the literature are more robust. The committee recognised that the life expectancy is uncertain but considered it reasonable to accept that risdiplam could meet the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA\" id=\"406-1-it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"406-1-3.15\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.15</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Having concluded that the short life-expectancy criterion was met for type 1 SMA, the committee recalled that the long-term survival estimates for these patients are very uncertain (see section 3.9).

The committee noted that nusinersen (TA588) was considered to have met the criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but not for types 2 or 3.

People with the condition have a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, and have worsening physical disability, mobility loss and respiratory dysfunction. SMA can be grouped into 5 main types (0 to 4), based on the age of onset and the maximum motor function reached. SMA type 0, the most severe, affects babies before birth. The babies do not develop any motor skills and often survive for only a few weeks after birth. Babies with type 1 SMA are unable to sit or roll because of severe muscle weakness, which gets worse over time. The muscle weakness also affects swallowing and breathing, and typically results in death within 2 years if respiratory support is not used. In type 2 SMA, the onset of symptoms is between 7 months and 18 months. People with this condition can sit independently at diagnosis. However, progressive loss of motor function means they have a reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. In type 3 SMA, there are varying degrees of muscle weakness, which appear between 18 months and 18 years. People with this condition can have a normal lifespan, and walk or sit unaided at some point, but many lose mobility and other functions over time. Type 4 SMA is the least severe and affects adults, who may have milder motor impairment and live a normal lifespan. The clinical experts explained that type 0 and type 4 SMA are rarely diagnosed in clinical practice in the NHS in England. The patient experts explained that SMA is a progressive disorder so all patients will experience more severe symptoms over time. The committee concluded that SMA is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disorder that affects all aspects of daily life.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam\" id=\"408-1-the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"408-1-3.2\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.2</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The patient experts commented that the SMA classification system does not always reflect the full extent of the disease. The boundaries between the different SMA types are blurred and can be subjective. They also explained that it was not originally intended to define populations who were eligible for treatment. One patient expert with a child with type 3 SMA described how progressive loss of motor function has affected all daily activities and being unable to access treatments such as nusinersen has a big effect on physical and mental health. The committee understood that risdiplam's marketing authorisation includes types 1 to 3 SMA as currently defined by the SMA classification system and these definitions were also used in the clinical evidence (see section 3.5). The committee acknowledged the limitations of the current SMA classification system but concluded that it had been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families\" id=\"408-1-sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\" data-heading-type=\"section\">SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"408-1-3.3\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.3</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The clinical and patient experts explained that most people with SMA need constant support. This can include full-time care and attention, needing physical effort (such as lifting and carrying) and causing loss of sleep for patients and carers, stress, and fear about loss of abilities. One patient expert with a child with type 2 SMA described how living with the condition can put considerable strain on relationships with other family members and friends. Siblings have a restricted social circle because of the fear of respiratory infections, and often act as young carers. As well as dealing with the physical and mental stress as the condition progresses, the financial burden also increases as more supportive equipment is needed. Another patient expert with type 2 SMA described the fear of losing fine motor skills and how being unable to work would affect the whole family. All these factors have a large effect on family members' health-related quality of life. The patient experts emphasised how caring for people with SMA affects the whole family and can cause physical, mental and financial issues. The committee concluded that SMA has a substantial effect on the quality of life of patients, caregivers and their families.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Comparator\" id=\"408-1-comparator\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"comparator\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Comparator</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam\" id=\"408-1-best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"408-1-3.4\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.4</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Nusinersen is the only disease-modifying treatment currently available for SMA. The clinical and patient experts explained that many people with SMA have spinal fusion so cannot have nusinersen because it is delivered by intrathecal injection and requires access to the lower spine. They commented that an oral treatment option would be welcome and would also address several issues related to the delivery of nusinersen including the use of sedation, radiographic imaging and anxiety associated with lumbar puncture. Nusinersen is recommended in NICE's guidance TA588 through a managed access agreement. This makes nusinersen available while more data is collected. However, nusinersen is not routinely commissioned in the NHS in England. So, current treatment for many people is best supportive care. The aim is to control symptoms, maintain movement and function for as long as possible and improve quality of life. This involves a multidisciplinary approach including respiratory, gastroenterology and orthopaedic care, as well as nutritional support, physiotherapy, assistive technologies, occupational therapy and social care. However, the clinical and patient experts emphasised that these supportive treatments do not affect disease progression, so people with SMA will ultimately become dependent on their families and carers. The committee was aware of an ongoing highly specialised technology evaluation for <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-hst10026\" target=\"_top\">onasemnogene abeparvovec for treating spinal muscular atrophy type 1</a>. It was aware that this treatment was recommended in draft guidance for routine commissioning for some babies 12 months or younger with SMA type 1. However, it understood that the guidance was not final and therefore onasemnogene abeparvovec could not be included as a comparator. The NHS England commissioning expert described the potential treatment pathway if risdiplam were to be recommended as a treatment option alongside nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec. They explained that repeated treatment switching would only be expected in exceptional circumstances, related to issues such as fertility or side effects. The committee recognised that treatment options used routinely in the NHS in England are currently limited and there is an unmet need for people with SMA. It recalled that best supportive care is routinely used in clinical practice in the NHS in England. It concluded that best supportive care was the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Clinical evidence\" id=\"408-1-clinical-evidence\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"clinical-evidence\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Clinical evidence</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3\" id=\"408-1-evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"408-1-3.5\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.5</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The main clinical effectiveness evidence for risdiplam came from 2 clinical studies:</p>\r\n          <ul class=\"itemizedlist indented\">\r\n            <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n              <p>SUNFISH, which is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre (excluding UK sites), phase 2, placebo-controlled trial.

RAINBOWFISH is a phase 2, single-arm study of babies 6 weeks or younger who had been genetically diagnosed with SMA but did not have symptoms. JEWELFISH is an open-label, single-arm study for SMA types 1, 2 and 3 in people of 6 months to 60 years who had previously enrolled in the MOONFISH study or who had previously had nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec or olesoxime. The ERG considered that although SUNFISH excluded patients with type 3 SMA who could walk, this group accounts for a small proportion of SMA cases. It also noted that SUNFISH and FIREFISH excluded patients who had previous treatment (see section 3.6). The committee noted the age restrictions used in both studies. It was aware that some babies may be diagnosed with type 1 SMA when they are older than 7 months. The clinical experts explained that the study populations were generally representative of patients with SMA in the NHS in England. The committee concluded that the evidence presented for SMA types 1 to 3 was suitable for decision making.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen\" id=\"408-1-there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\" data-heading-type=\"section\">There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"408-1-3.6\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.6</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The company did not present any clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for people who have had nusinersen.

The results from FIREFISH were compared against pre-defined performance criteria, based on natural history data for patients with type 1 SMA. The results (see table 2) suggest that after 12 months of treatment with risdiplam, more patients were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds than would be expected for patients with type 1 SMA. Overall survival was 93% (90% confidence interval 82.2% to 97.1%). After technical engagement, both the company and the ERG used the company's matched adjusted indirect comparison to model the treatment effect of risdiplam compared with best supportive care for type 1 SMA. The indirect comparison showed improvements in motor function (such as sitting with and without support), ventilation-free survival and overall survival (the company considers the data to be confidential so it cannot be reported here). The company and the ERG agreed that improvements seen in both SUNFISH and FIREFISH were clinically important. The patient experts described their experiences of using risdiplam and noted improvements in motor function, lung capacity, energy levels and stamina. They explained that even very small improvements in fine motor skills and upper limb function were very important because they allow patients to maintain independence. They emphasised that although the studies showed improvements in motor function, they would also highly value a treatment that keeps the disease stable and stops it getting worse. The committee agreed that the clinical evidence showed improved motor function with risdiplam but noted that overall survival data were only available for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n      <div class=\"informaltable\">\r\n        <table frame=\"all\" border=\"1\" id=\"ID0E2F\">\r\n          <caption>\r\n            <strong>Table 1 Results from SUNFISH for SMA types 2 and 3 at 12‑month follow up</strong>\r\n          </caption>\r\n          <thead>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Outcome</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Risdiplam n=120 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Placebo n=60 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Difference, risdiplam minus placebo (95% CI)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>p-value</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </thead>\r\n          <tbody>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>MFM-32 total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.36 (0.38)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.19 (0.52) </p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.55 (0.30 to 2.81)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02*, 0.02**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>HFMSE total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.95 (0.33)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.37 (0.46)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.58 (–0.53 to 1.69)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.30**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>RULM total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.61 (0.31)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02 (0.43)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.59 (0.55 to 2.62)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.05*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Caregiver-reported SMAIS score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.65 (0.50)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.91 (0.67)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>2.55 (0.93 to 4.17)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Patient-reported SMAIS total score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.04 (0.65)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.40 (0.86)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.45 (–0.68 to 3.57)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.18</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>Table note: All data are least squares mean change from baseline.

Both models compared risdiplam with best supportive care. Health-state transitions were based on assessments of motor milestones using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Module 2 for type 1 SMA, and the 32 item Motor Function Measure and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. In the type 1 model, the ERG noted that the company's approach overestimates overall survival in the best supportive care arm. It stated that the company should have applied the hazard ratio to the best supportive care group instead of applying the inverse of the hazard ratio to the risdiplam group. After technical engagement, the company added a treatment-effect plateau similar to that used in TA588. The plateau assumed patients who have had risdiplam will not reach additional motor milestones after 66 months for SMA type 1 and 26 months for SMA type 2 or 3. The ERG explained that the company's models were broadly consistent with the final model used in TA588 but there were differences in the stopping rule and caregiver assumptions (see sections 0 and 3.13).

This restricted its use to a maximum of 50 years for type 1 SMA and 30 years for types 2 and 3 SMA. The committee noted that this approach differed to the stopping criteria in TA588, which was based on clinical outcomes including repeated loss of motor function, the need for ventilation and scoliosis. Clinical advice to the company suggested that a time-based rule may be easy to implement in the NHS in England and may be preferred to the current criteria set out in TA588 because it would avoid pressure for continuous motor milestone improvement. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the current stopping rules in TA588 were problematic and put undue strain on patients and their caregivers. The clinical expert suggested that a maximum treatment duration of 50 years would be reasonable for type 1 SMA, but 30 years may not be appropriate for types 2 and 3. This is because many adults may still benefit from risdiplam and it would be unfair to stop treatment for these people. The ERG preferred not to include the company's time-based stopping rule because it was not based on any evidence. But it noted that a stopping rule based on clinical criteria may improve risdiplam's cost-effectiveness. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the stopping rule used in TA588 is challenging to implement in clinical practice. So, the committee considered that appropriate stopping criteria should be explored in collaboration with clinical and patient experts and the wider SMA community. It was aware that there is ongoing work reviewing the TA588 stopping criteria for nusinersen and agreed that this could also be relevant for risdiplam. In the absence of updated criteria from TA588, the committee concluded that the company's stopping rules may not be appropriate and it would like to see stopping rules based on clinical criteria that have been agreed with clinical and patient experts.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Utility values\" id=\"408-1-utility-values\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"utility-values\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Utility values</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger\" id=\"408-1-the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"408-1-3.12\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.12</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>After technical engagement, the company included in its base case an additional utility gain to reflect risdiplam's potential benefits in fine motor skills.

The committee was sympathetic to these arguments and noted that SUNFISH showed improvements in upper limb function at 12 months and also in the SMA independence scale (see table 1).

The company used an additive approach and assumed that caregiver health-related quality of life increased linearly with each motor milestone that was met. The ERG explained that the company's additive approach assumed that after a patient died the caregiver health-related quality of life was zero. This increased the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains for risdiplam because patients live longer. The ERG did not think this was appropriate because it assumed society places value on caregivers of surviving patients with SMA but does not for bereaved caregivers. Submissions at technical engagement from patient and professional organisations emphasised that bereavement would have a significant and sustained effect on a caregiver's health-related quality of life. After technical engagement, the ERG presented its preferred analysis and 2 scenario analyses that explored the effects of bereavement. It preferred to apply a disutility (reduction in health-related quality of life) that was linked to the health state of the patient with SMA. But in the base case, after the patient died, the caregiver utility value was assumed to return to that of the general population. In the first scenario, the ERG applied a disutility of -0.04 from Song et al. (2010) for 20 years after the patient with SMA died and in the second scenario the same disutility was applied for the maximum time horizon (90 years). The ERG cautioned that the analyses were limited because they used arbitrary assumptions and the company's model did not include caregiver ageing or survival. The committee understood that the ERG's disutility approach was consistent with TA588 and was not aware of any previous technology appraisals that used the company's preferred additive approach to model caregiver utility values. It also noted that while the guide to the methods of technology evaluation states that when relevant, direct health effects for carers can be included in analyses, it is unclear whether this extends to valuing caregiver bereavement. It recalled that SMA has a substantial effect on carers and families as well as patients and can affect multiple members of the extended family (see section 3.3). It was aware that using the ERG's preferred disutility approach substantially increased the cost-effectiveness ratios, particularly for type 1 SMA. This was because the substantial caregiver disutilities were subtracted from the patient utility values, which themselves reflect a poor quality of life. So increased survival results in a low number of QALYs, but at a high extra cost. This was less of an issue for type 2 and type 3 SMA because the additional survival is associated with higher patient utility and lower carer disutility than in the type 1 model, meaning a higher number of QALYs can be accrued. The company noted that this was counterintuitive because it made a life-extending treatment appear to be less cost effective. It also noted that using the ERG's approach meant that risdiplam was not cost effective, even when there was no cost for risdiplam. The ERG explained that the cost-effectiveness of risdiplam was related to other factors including extended overall survival and high disease management costs. Also, the committee understood that the company preferred to assume each patient with SMA would have 2.2 caregivers. However, the ERG preferred to assume 3 caregivers for patients with type 2 or 3 SMA who cannot sit because this is consistent with TA588. The committee did not accept the company's approach to caregiver utility but recognised the difficulties in valuing caregiver utility values. It noted that the ERG approach also had limitations and resulted in particularly high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for type 1 SMA. Despite accepting the logic of the ERG's modelling, it did not agree that including carer quality of life would result in fewer QALYs being accrued by carers when risdiplam extends survival.  Therefore, it would welcome suggestions for alternative approaches for valuing caregiver quality of life in this appraisal. The committee concluded that the ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with TA588 but neither the company's nor the ERG approach is ideal, so there is substantial uncertainty.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"End of life\" id=\"408-1-end-of-life\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"end-of-life\" data-heading-type=\"section\">End of life</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA\" id=\"408-1-it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"408-1-3.14\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.14</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg9\" target=\"_top\">guide to the methods of technology appraisal</a>. The company proposed that risdiplam met NICE's criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but did not make a case for meeting the criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. The committee accepted that risdiplam did not meet the end-of-life criteria in the type 2 and 3 population because, although risdiplam may provide a survival benefit, life expectancy was likely to be over 2 years. For type 1 SMA, the company noted that survival depends on the nature and extent of supportive care. This may vary by country, NHS trust, clinician, and the preferences of patients and their families. The median age of death or permanent respiratory support in published natural history studies was 9 months to 13 months. The ERG commented that mean survival in the company's model for people with type 1 SMA having best supportive care was 4.88 years but this was likely to be an overestimate because of the way the company had applied the hazard ratios in the model (see section 3.10). The committee noted that it usually prefers to assess whether this criterion is met by referring to the mean survival predicted by the model. However, it accepted the limitations of the model in this case mean that estimates from the literature are more robust. The committee recognised that the life expectancy is uncertain but considered it reasonable to accept that risdiplam could meet the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA\" id=\"408-1-it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"408-1-3.15\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.15</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Having concluded that the short life-expectancy criterion was met for type 1 SMA, the committee recalled that the long-term survival estimates for these patients are very uncertain (see section 3.9).

The committee noted that nusinersen (TA588) was considered to have met the criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but not for types 2 or 3.

People with the condition have a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, and have worsening physical disability, mobility loss and respiratory dysfunction. SMA can be grouped into 5 main types (0 to 4), based on the age of onset and the maximum motor function reached. SMA type 0, the most severe, affects babies before birth. The babies do not develop any motor skills and often survive for only a few weeks after birth. Babies with type 1 SMA are unable to sit or roll because of severe muscle weakness, which gets worse over time. The muscle weakness also affects swallowing and breathing, and typically results in death within 2 years if respiratory support is not used. In type 2 SMA, the onset of symptoms is between 7 months and 18 months. People with this condition can sit independently at diagnosis. However, progressive loss of motor function means they have a reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. In type 3 SMA, there are varying degrees of muscle weakness, which appear between 18 months and 18 years. People with this condition can have a normal lifespan, and walk or sit unaided at some point, but many lose mobility and other functions over time. Type 4 SMA is the least severe and affects adults, who may have milder motor impairment and live a normal lifespan. The clinical experts explained that type 0 and type 4 SMA are rarely diagnosed in clinical practice in the NHS in England. The patient experts explained that SMA is a progressive disorder so all patients will experience more severe symptoms over time. The committee concluded that SMA is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disorder that affects all aspects of daily life.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam\" id=\"409-1-the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"409-1-3.2\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.2</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The patient experts commented that the SMA classification system does not always reflect the full extent of the disease. The boundaries between the different SMA types are blurred and can be subjective. They also explained that it was not originally intended to define populations who were eligible for treatment. One patient expert with a child with type 3 SMA described how progressive loss of motor function has affected all daily activities and being unable to access treatments such as nusinersen has a big effect on physical and mental health. The committee understood that risdiplam's marketing authorisation includes types 1 to 3 SMA as currently defined by the SMA classification system and these definitions were also used in the clinical evidence (see section 3.5). The committee acknowledged the limitations of the current SMA classification system but concluded that it had been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families\" id=\"409-1-sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\" data-heading-type=\"section\">SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"409-1-3.3\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.3</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The clinical and patient experts explained that most people with SMA need constant support. This can include full-time care and attention, needing physical effort (such as lifting and carrying) and causing loss of sleep for patients and carers, stress, and fear about loss of abilities. One patient expert with a child with type 2 SMA described how living with the condition can put considerable strain on relationships with other family members and friends. Siblings have a restricted social circle because of the fear of respiratory infections, and often act as young carers. As well as dealing with the physical and mental stress as the condition progresses, the financial burden also increases as more supportive equipment is needed. Another patient expert with type 2 SMA described the fear of losing fine motor skills and how being unable to work would affect the whole family. All these factors have a large effect on family members' health-related quality of life. The patient experts emphasised how caring for people with SMA affects the whole family and can cause physical, mental and financial issues. The committee concluded that SMA has a substantial effect on the quality of life of patients, caregivers and their families.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Comparator\" id=\"409-1-comparator\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"comparator\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Comparator</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam\" id=\"409-1-best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"409-1-3.4\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.4</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Nusinersen is the only disease-modifying treatment currently available for SMA. The clinical and patient experts explained that many people with SMA have spinal fusion so cannot have nusinersen because it is delivered by intrathecal injection and requires access to the lower spine. They commented that an oral treatment option would be welcome and would also address several issues related to the delivery of nusinersen including the use of sedation, radiographic imaging and anxiety associated with lumbar puncture. Nusinersen is recommended in NICE's guidance TA588 through a managed access agreement. This makes nusinersen available while more data is collected. However, nusinersen is not routinely commissioned in the NHS in England. So, current treatment for many people is best supportive care. The aim is to control symptoms, maintain movement and function for as long as possible and improve quality of life. This involves a multidisciplinary approach including respiratory, gastroenterology and orthopaedic care, as well as nutritional support, physiotherapy, assistive technologies, occupational therapy and social care. However, the clinical and patient experts emphasised that these supportive treatments do not affect disease progression, so people with SMA will ultimately become dependent on their families and carers. The committee was aware of an ongoing highly specialised technology evaluation for <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-hst10026\" target=\"_top\">onasemnogene abeparvovec for treating spinal muscular atrophy type 1</a>. It was aware that this treatment was recommended in draft guidance for routine commissioning for some babies 12 months or younger with SMA type 1. However, it understood that the guidance was not final and therefore onasemnogene abeparvovec could not be included as a comparator. The NHS England commissioning expert described the potential treatment pathway if risdiplam were to be recommended as a treatment option alongside nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec. They explained that repeated treatment switching would only be expected in exceptional circumstances, related to issues such as fertility or side effects. The committee recognised that treatment options used routinely in the NHS in England are currently limited and there is an unmet need for people with SMA. It recalled that best supportive care is routinely used in clinical practice in the NHS in England. It concluded that best supportive care was the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Clinical evidence\" id=\"409-1-clinical-evidence\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"clinical-evidence\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Clinical evidence</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3\" id=\"409-1-evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"409-1-3.5\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.5</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The main clinical effectiveness evidence for risdiplam came from 2 clinical studies:</p>\r\n          <ul class=\"itemizedlist indented\">\r\n            <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n              <p>SUNFISH, which is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre (excluding UK sites), phase 2, placebo-controlled trial.

RAINBOWFISH is a phase 2, single-arm study of babies 6 weeks or younger who had been genetically diagnosed with SMA but did not have symptoms. JEWELFISH is an open-label, single-arm study for SMA types 1, 2 and 3 in people of 6 months to 60 years who had previously enrolled in the MOONFISH study or who had previously had nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec or olesoxime. The ERG considered that although SUNFISH excluded patients with type 3 SMA who could walk, this group accounts for a small proportion of SMA cases. It also noted that SUNFISH and FIREFISH excluded patients who had previous treatment (see section 3.6). The committee noted the age restrictions used in both studies. It was aware that some babies may be diagnosed with type 1 SMA when they are older than 7 months. The clinical experts explained that the study populations were generally representative of patients with SMA in the NHS in England. The committee concluded that the evidence presented for SMA types 1 to 3 was suitable for decision making.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen\" id=\"409-1-there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\" data-heading-type=\"section\">There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"409-1-3.6\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.6</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The company did not present any clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for people who have had nusinersen.

The results from FIREFISH were compared against pre-defined performance criteria, based on natural history data for patients with type 1 SMA. The results (see table 2) suggest that after 12 months of treatment with risdiplam, more patients were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds than would be expected for patients with type 1 SMA. Overall survival was 93% (90% confidence interval 82.2% to 97.1%). After technical engagement, both the company and the ERG used the company's matched adjusted indirect comparison to model the treatment effect of risdiplam compared with best supportive care for type 1 SMA. The indirect comparison showed improvements in motor function (such as sitting with and without support), ventilation-free survival and overall survival (the company considers the data to be confidential so it cannot be reported here). The company and the ERG agreed that improvements seen in both SUNFISH and FIREFISH were clinically important. The patient experts described their experiences of using risdiplam and noted improvements in motor function, lung capacity, energy levels and stamina. They explained that even very small improvements in fine motor skills and upper limb function were very important because they allow patients to maintain independence. They emphasised that although the studies showed improvements in motor function, they would also highly value a treatment that keeps the disease stable and stops it getting worse. The committee agreed that the clinical evidence showed improved motor function with risdiplam but noted that overall survival data were only available for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n      <div class=\"informaltable\">\r\n        <table frame=\"all\" border=\"1\" id=\"ID0E2F\">\r\n          <caption>\r\n            <strong>Table 1 Results from SUNFISH for SMA types 2 and 3 at 12‑month follow up</strong>\r\n          </caption>\r\n          <thead>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Outcome</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Risdiplam n=120 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Placebo n=60 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Difference, risdiplam minus placebo (95% CI)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>p-value</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </thead>\r\n          <tbody>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>MFM-32 total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.36 (0.38)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.19 (0.52) </p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.55 (0.30 to 2.81)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02*, 0.02**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>HFMSE total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.95 (0.33)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.37 (0.46)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.58 (–0.53 to 1.69)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.30**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>RULM total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.61 (0.31)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02 (0.43)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.59 (0.55 to 2.62)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.05*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Caregiver-reported SMAIS score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.65 (0.50)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.91 (0.67)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>2.55 (0.93 to 4.17)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Patient-reported SMAIS total score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.04 (0.65)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.40 (0.86)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.45 (–0.68 to 3.57)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.18</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>Table note: All data are least squares mean change from baseline.

Both models compared risdiplam with best supportive care. Health-state transitions were based on assessments of motor milestones using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Module 2 for type 1 SMA, and the 32 item Motor Function Measure and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. In the type 1 model, the ERG noted that the company's approach overestimates overall survival in the best supportive care arm. It stated that the company should have applied the hazard ratio to the best supportive care group instead of applying the inverse of the hazard ratio to the risdiplam group. After technical engagement, the company added a treatment-effect plateau similar to that used in TA588. The plateau assumed patients who have had risdiplam will not reach additional motor milestones after 66 months for SMA type 1 and 26 months for SMA type 2 or 3. The ERG explained that the company's models were broadly consistent with the final model used in TA588 but there were differences in the stopping rule and caregiver assumptions (see sections 0 and 3.13).

This restricted its use to a maximum of 50 years for type 1 SMA and 30 years for types 2 and 3 SMA. The committee noted that this approach differed to the stopping criteria in TA588, which was based on clinical outcomes including repeated loss of motor function, the need for ventilation and scoliosis. Clinical advice to the company suggested that a time-based rule may be easy to implement in the NHS in England and may be preferred to the current criteria set out in TA588 because it would avoid pressure for continuous motor milestone improvement. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the current stopping rules in TA588 were problematic and put undue strain on patients and their caregivers. The clinical expert suggested that a maximum treatment duration of 50 years would be reasonable for type 1 SMA, but 30 years may not be appropriate for types 2 and 3. This is because many adults may still benefit from risdiplam and it would be unfair to stop treatment for these people. The ERG preferred not to include the company's time-based stopping rule because it was not based on any evidence. But it noted that a stopping rule based on clinical criteria may improve risdiplam's cost-effectiveness. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the stopping rule used in TA588 is challenging to implement in clinical practice. So, the committee considered that appropriate stopping criteria should be explored in collaboration with clinical and patient experts and the wider SMA community. It was aware that there is ongoing work reviewing the TA588 stopping criteria for nusinersen and agreed that this could also be relevant for risdiplam. In the absence of updated criteria from TA588, the committee concluded that the company's stopping rules may not be appropriate and it would like to see stopping rules based on clinical criteria that have been agreed with clinical and patient experts.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Utility values\" id=\"409-1-utility-values\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"utility-values\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Utility values</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger\" id=\"409-1-the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"409-1-3.12\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.12</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>After technical engagement, the company included in its base case an additional utility gain to reflect risdiplam's potential benefits in fine motor skills.

The committee was sympathetic to these arguments and noted that SUNFISH showed improvements in upper limb function at 12 months and also in the SMA independence scale (see table 1).

The company used an additive approach and assumed that caregiver health-related quality of life increased linearly with each motor milestone that was met. The ERG explained that the company's additive approach assumed that after a patient died the caregiver health-related quality of life was zero. This increased the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains for risdiplam because patients live longer. The ERG did not think this was appropriate because it assumed society places value on caregivers of surviving patients with SMA but does not for bereaved caregivers. Submissions at technical engagement from patient and professional organisations emphasised that bereavement would have a significant and sustained effect on a caregiver's health-related quality of life. After technical engagement, the ERG presented its preferred analysis and 2 scenario analyses that explored the effects of bereavement. It preferred to apply a disutility (reduction in health-related quality of life) that was linked to the health state of the patient with SMA. But in the base case, after the patient died, the caregiver utility value was assumed to return to that of the general population. In the first scenario, the ERG applied a disutility of -0.04 from Song et al. (2010) for 20 years after the patient with SMA died and in the second scenario the same disutility was applied for the maximum time horizon (90 years). The ERG cautioned that the analyses were limited because they used arbitrary assumptions and the company's model did not include caregiver ageing or survival. The committee understood that the ERG's disutility approach was consistent with TA588 and was not aware of any previous technology appraisals that used the company's preferred additive approach to model caregiver utility values. It also noted that while the guide to the methods of technology evaluation states that when relevant, direct health effects for carers can be included in analyses, it is unclear whether this extends to valuing caregiver bereavement. It recalled that SMA has a substantial effect on carers and families as well as patients and can affect multiple members of the extended family (see section 3.3). It was aware that using the ERG's preferred disutility approach substantially increased the cost-effectiveness ratios, particularly for type 1 SMA. This was because the substantial caregiver disutilities were subtracted from the patient utility values, which themselves reflect a poor quality of life. So increased survival results in a low number of QALYs, but at a high extra cost. This was less of an issue for type 2 and type 3 SMA because the additional survival is associated with higher patient utility and lower carer disutility than in the type 1 model, meaning a higher number of QALYs can be accrued. The company noted that this was counterintuitive because it made a life-extending treatment appear to be less cost effective. It also noted that using the ERG's approach meant that risdiplam was not cost effective, even when there was no cost for risdiplam. The ERG explained that the cost-effectiveness of risdiplam was related to other factors including extended overall survival and high disease management costs. Also, the committee understood that the company preferred to assume each patient with SMA would have 2.2 caregivers. However, the ERG preferred to assume 3 caregivers for patients with type 2 or 3 SMA who cannot sit because this is consistent with TA588. The committee did not accept the company's approach to caregiver utility but recognised the difficulties in valuing caregiver utility values. It noted that the ERG approach also had limitations and resulted in particularly high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for type 1 SMA. Despite accepting the logic of the ERG's modelling, it did not agree that including carer quality of life would result in fewer QALYs being accrued by carers when risdiplam extends survival.  Therefore, it would welcome suggestions for alternative approaches for valuing caregiver quality of life in this appraisal. The committee concluded that the ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with TA588 but neither the company's nor the ERG approach is ideal, so there is substantial uncertainty.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"End of life\" id=\"409-1-end-of-life\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"end-of-life\" data-heading-type=\"section\">End of life</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA\" id=\"409-1-it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"409-1-3.14\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.14</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg9\" target=\"_top\">guide to the methods of technology appraisal</a>. The company proposed that risdiplam met NICE's criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but did not make a case for meeting the criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. The committee accepted that risdiplam did not meet the end-of-life criteria in the type 2 and 3 population because, although risdiplam may provide a survival benefit, life expectancy was likely to be over 2 years. For type 1 SMA, the company noted that survival depends on the nature and extent of supportive care. This may vary by country, NHS trust, clinician, and the preferences of patients and their families. The median age of death or permanent respiratory support in published natural history studies was 9 months to 13 months. The ERG commented that mean survival in the company's model for people with type 1 SMA having best supportive care was 4.88 years but this was likely to be an overestimate because of the way the company had applied the hazard ratios in the model (see section 3.10). The committee noted that it usually prefers to assess whether this criterion is met by referring to the mean survival predicted by the model. However, it accepted the limitations of the model in this case mean that estimates from the literature are more robust. The committee recognised that the life expectancy is uncertain but considered it reasonable to accept that risdiplam could meet the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA\" id=\"409-1-it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"409-1-3.15\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.15</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Having concluded that the short life-expectancy criterion was met for type 1 SMA, the committee recalled that the long-term survival estimates for these patients are very uncertain (see section 3.9).

The committee noted that nusinersen (TA588) was considered to have met the criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but not for types 2 or 3.

People with the condition have a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, and have worsening physical disability, mobility loss and respiratory dysfunction. SMA can be grouped into 5 main types (0 to 4), based on the age of onset and the maximum motor function reached. SMA type 0, the most severe, affects babies before birth. The babies do not develop any motor skills and often survive for only a few weeks after birth. Babies with type 1 SMA are unable to sit or roll because of severe muscle weakness, which gets worse over time. The muscle weakness also affects swallowing and breathing, and typically results in death within 2 years if respiratory support is not used. In type 2 SMA, the onset of symptoms is between 7 months and 18 months. People with this condition can sit independently at diagnosis. However, progressive loss of motor function means they have a reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. In type 3 SMA, there are varying degrees of muscle weakness, which appear between 18 months and 18 years. People with this condition can have a normal lifespan, and walk or sit unaided at some point, but many lose mobility and other functions over time. Type 4 SMA is the least severe and affects adults, who may have milder motor impairment and live a normal lifespan. The clinical experts explained that type 0 and type 4 SMA are rarely diagnosed in clinical practice in the NHS in England. The patient experts explained that SMA is a progressive disorder so all patients will experience more severe symptoms over time. The committee concluded that SMA is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disorder that affects all aspects of daily life.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam\" id=\"410-1-the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"410-1-3.2\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.2</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The patient experts commented that the SMA classification system does not always reflect the full extent of the disease. The boundaries between the different SMA types are blurred and can be subjective. They also explained that it was not originally intended to define populations who were eligible for treatment. One patient expert with a child with type 3 SMA described how progressive loss of motor function has affected all daily activities and being unable to access treatments such as nusinersen has a big effect on physical and mental health. The committee understood that risdiplam's marketing authorisation includes types 1 to 3 SMA as currently defined by the SMA classification system and these definitions were also used in the clinical evidence (see section 3.5). The committee acknowledged the limitations of the current SMA classification system but concluded that it had been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families\" id=\"410-1-sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\" data-heading-type=\"section\">SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"410-1-3.3\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.3</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The clinical and patient experts explained that most people with SMA need constant support. This can include full-time care and attention, needing physical effort (such as lifting and carrying) and causing loss of sleep for patients and carers, stress, and fear about loss of abilities. One patient expert with a child with type 2 SMA described how living with the condition can put considerable strain on relationships with other family members and friends. Siblings have a restricted social circle because of the fear of respiratory infections, and often act as young carers. As well as dealing with the physical and mental stress as the condition progresses, the financial burden also increases as more supportive equipment is needed. Another patient expert with type 2 SMA described the fear of losing fine motor skills and how being unable to work would affect the whole family. All these factors have a large effect on family members' health-related quality of life. The patient experts emphasised how caring for people with SMA affects the whole family and can cause physical, mental and financial issues. The committee concluded that SMA has a substantial effect on the quality of life of patients, caregivers and their families.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Comparator\" id=\"410-1-comparator\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"comparator\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Comparator</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam\" id=\"410-1-best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"410-1-3.4\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.4</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Nusinersen is the only disease-modifying treatment currently available for SMA. The clinical and patient experts explained that many people with SMA have spinal fusion so cannot have nusinersen because it is delivered by intrathecal injection and requires access to the lower spine. They commented that an oral treatment option would be welcome and would also address several issues related to the delivery of nusinersen including the use of sedation, radiographic imaging and anxiety associated with lumbar puncture. Nusinersen is recommended in NICE's guidance TA588 through a managed access agreement. This makes nusinersen available while more data is collected. However, nusinersen is not routinely commissioned in the NHS in England. So, current treatment for many people is best supportive care. The aim is to control symptoms, maintain movement and function for as long as possible and improve quality of life. This involves a multidisciplinary approach including respiratory, gastroenterology and orthopaedic care, as well as nutritional support, physiotherapy, assistive technologies, occupational therapy and social care. However, the clinical and patient experts emphasised that these supportive treatments do not affect disease progression, so people with SMA will ultimately become dependent on their families and carers. The committee was aware of an ongoing highly specialised technology evaluation for <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-hst10026\" target=\"_top\">onasemnogene abeparvovec for treating spinal muscular atrophy type 1</a>. It was aware that this treatment was recommended in draft guidance for routine commissioning for some babies 12 months or younger with SMA type 1. However, it understood that the guidance was not final and therefore onasemnogene abeparvovec could not be included as a comparator. The NHS England commissioning expert described the potential treatment pathway if risdiplam were to be recommended as a treatment option alongside nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec. They explained that repeated treatment switching would only be expected in exceptional circumstances, related to issues such as fertility or side effects. The committee recognised that treatment options used routinely in the NHS in England are currently limited and there is an unmet need for people with SMA. It recalled that best supportive care is routinely used in clinical practice in the NHS in England. It concluded that best supportive care was the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Clinical evidence\" id=\"410-1-clinical-evidence\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"clinical-evidence\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Clinical evidence</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3\" id=\"410-1-evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"410-1-3.5\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.5</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The main clinical effectiveness evidence for risdiplam came from 2 clinical studies:</p>\r\n          <ul class=\"itemizedlist indented\">\r\n            <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n              <p>SUNFISH, which is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre (excluding UK sites), phase 2, placebo-controlled trial.

RAINBOWFISH is a phase 2, single-arm study of babies 6 weeks or younger who had been genetically diagnosed with SMA but did not have symptoms. JEWELFISH is an open-label, single-arm study for SMA types 1, 2 and 3 in people of 6 months to 60 years who had previously enrolled in the MOONFISH study or who had previously had nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec or olesoxime. The ERG considered that although SUNFISH excluded patients with type 3 SMA who could walk, this group accounts for a small proportion of SMA cases. It also noted that SUNFISH and FIREFISH excluded patients who had previous treatment (see section 3.6). The committee noted the age restrictions used in both studies. It was aware that some babies may be diagnosed with type 1 SMA when they are older than 7 months. The clinical experts explained that the study populations were generally representative of patients with SMA in the NHS in England. The committee concluded that the evidence presented for SMA types 1 to 3 was suitable for decision making.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen\" id=\"410-1-there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\" data-heading-type=\"section\">There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"410-1-3.6\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.6</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The company did not present any clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for people who have had nusinersen.

The results from FIREFISH were compared against pre-defined performance criteria, based on natural history data for patients with type 1 SMA. The results (see table 2) suggest that after 12 months of treatment with risdiplam, more patients were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds than would be expected for patients with type 1 SMA. Overall survival was 93% (90% confidence interval 82.2% to 97.1%). After technical engagement, both the company and the ERG used the company's matched adjusted indirect comparison to model the treatment effect of risdiplam compared with best supportive care for type 1 SMA. The indirect comparison showed improvements in motor function (such as sitting with and without support), ventilation-free survival and overall survival (the company considers the data to be confidential so it cannot be reported here). The company and the ERG agreed that improvements seen in both SUNFISH and FIREFISH were clinically important. The patient experts described their experiences of using risdiplam and noted improvements in motor function, lung capacity, energy levels and stamina. They explained that even very small improvements in fine motor skills and upper limb function were very important because they allow patients to maintain independence. They emphasised that although the studies showed improvements in motor function, they would also highly value a treatment that keeps the disease stable and stops it getting worse. The committee agreed that the clinical evidence showed improved motor function with risdiplam but noted that overall survival data were only available for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n      <div class=\"informaltable\">\r\n        <table frame=\"all\" border=\"1\" id=\"ID0E2F\">\r\n          <caption>\r\n            <strong>Table 1 Results from SUNFISH for SMA types 2 and 3 at 12‑month follow up</strong>\r\n          </caption>\r\n          <thead>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Outcome</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Risdiplam n=120 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Placebo n=60 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Difference, risdiplam minus placebo (95% CI)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>p-value</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </thead>\r\n          <tbody>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>MFM-32 total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.36 (0.38)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.19 (0.52) </p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.55 (0.30 to 2.81)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02*, 0.02**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>HFMSE total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.95 (0.33)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.37 (0.46)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.58 (–0.53 to 1.69)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.30**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>RULM total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.61 (0.31)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02 (0.43)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.59 (0.55 to 2.62)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.05*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Caregiver-reported SMAIS score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.65 (0.50)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.91 (0.67)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>2.55 (0.93 to 4.17)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Patient-reported SMAIS total score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.04 (0.65)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.40 (0.86)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.45 (–0.68 to 3.57)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.18</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>Table note: All data are least squares mean change from baseline.

Both models compared risdiplam with best supportive care. Health-state transitions were based on assessments of motor milestones using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Module 2 for type 1 SMA, and the 32 item Motor Function Measure and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. In the type 1 model, the ERG noted that the company's approach overestimates overall survival in the best supportive care arm. It stated that the company should have applied the hazard ratio to the best supportive care group instead of applying the inverse of the hazard ratio to the risdiplam group. After technical engagement, the company added a treatment-effect plateau similar to that used in TA588. The plateau assumed patients who have had risdiplam will not reach additional motor milestones after 66 months for SMA type 1 and 26 months for SMA type 2 or 3. The ERG explained that the company's models were broadly consistent with the final model used in TA588 but there were differences in the stopping rule and caregiver assumptions (see sections 0 and 3.13).

This restricted its use to a maximum of 50 years for type 1 SMA and 30 years for types 2 and 3 SMA. The committee noted that this approach differed to the stopping criteria in TA588, which was based on clinical outcomes including repeated loss of motor function, the need for ventilation and scoliosis. Clinical advice to the company suggested that a time-based rule may be easy to implement in the NHS in England and may be preferred to the current criteria set out in TA588 because it would avoid pressure for continuous motor milestone improvement. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the current stopping rules in TA588 were problematic and put undue strain on patients and their caregivers. The clinical expert suggested that a maximum treatment duration of 50 years would be reasonable for type 1 SMA, but 30 years may not be appropriate for types 2 and 3. This is because many adults may still benefit from risdiplam and it would be unfair to stop treatment for these people. The ERG preferred not to include the company's time-based stopping rule because it was not based on any evidence. But it noted that a stopping rule based on clinical criteria may improve risdiplam's cost-effectiveness. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the stopping rule used in TA588 is challenging to implement in clinical practice. So, the committee considered that appropriate stopping criteria should be explored in collaboration with clinical and patient experts and the wider SMA community. It was aware that there is ongoing work reviewing the TA588 stopping criteria for nusinersen and agreed that this could also be relevant for risdiplam. In the absence of updated criteria from TA588, the committee concluded that the company's stopping rules may not be appropriate and it would like to see stopping rules based on clinical criteria that have been agreed with clinical and patient experts.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Utility values\" id=\"410-1-utility-values\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"utility-values\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Utility values</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger\" id=\"410-1-the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"410-1-3.12\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.12</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>After technical engagement, the company included in its base case an additional utility gain to reflect risdiplam's potential benefits in fine motor skills.

The committee was sympathetic to these arguments and noted that SUNFISH showed improvements in upper limb function at 12 months and also in the SMA independence scale (see table 1).

The company used an additive approach and assumed that caregiver health-related quality of life increased linearly with each motor milestone that was met. The ERG explained that the company's additive approach assumed that after a patient died the caregiver health-related quality of life was zero. This increased the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains for risdiplam because patients live longer. The ERG did not think this was appropriate because it assumed society places value on caregivers of surviving patients with SMA but does not for bereaved caregivers. Submissions at technical engagement from patient and professional organisations emphasised that bereavement would have a significant and sustained effect on a caregiver's health-related quality of life. After technical engagement, the ERG presented its preferred analysis and 2 scenario analyses that explored the effects of bereavement. It preferred to apply a disutility (reduction in health-related quality of life) that was linked to the health state of the patient with SMA. But in the base case, after the patient died, the caregiver utility value was assumed to return to that of the general population. In the first scenario, the ERG applied a disutility of -0.04 from Song et al. (2010) for 20 years after the patient with SMA died and in the second scenario the same disutility was applied for the maximum time horizon (90 years). The ERG cautioned that the analyses were limited because they used arbitrary assumptions and the company's model did not include caregiver ageing or survival. The committee understood that the ERG's disutility approach was consistent with TA588 and was not aware of any previous technology appraisals that used the company's preferred additive approach to model caregiver utility values. It also noted that while the guide to the methods of technology evaluation states that when relevant, direct health effects for carers can be included in analyses, it is unclear whether this extends to valuing caregiver bereavement. It recalled that SMA has a substantial effect on carers and families as well as patients and can affect multiple members of the extended family (see section 3.3). It was aware that using the ERG's preferred disutility approach substantially increased the cost-effectiveness ratios, particularly for type 1 SMA. This was because the substantial caregiver disutilities were subtracted from the patient utility values, which themselves reflect a poor quality of life. So increased survival results in a low number of QALYs, but at a high extra cost. This was less of an issue for type 2 and type 3 SMA because the additional survival is associated with higher patient utility and lower carer disutility than in the type 1 model, meaning a higher number of QALYs can be accrued. The company noted that this was counterintuitive because it made a life-extending treatment appear to be less cost effective. It also noted that using the ERG's approach meant that risdiplam was not cost effective, even when there was no cost for risdiplam. The ERG explained that the cost-effectiveness of risdiplam was related to other factors including extended overall survival and high disease management costs. Also, the committee understood that the company preferred to assume each patient with SMA would have 2.2 caregivers. However, the ERG preferred to assume 3 caregivers for patients with type 2 or 3 SMA who cannot sit because this is consistent with TA588. The committee did not accept the company's approach to caregiver utility but recognised the difficulties in valuing caregiver utility values. It noted that the ERG approach also had limitations and resulted in particularly high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for type 1 SMA. Despite accepting the logic of the ERG's modelling, it did not agree that including carer quality of life would result in fewer QALYs being accrued by carers when risdiplam extends survival.  Therefore, it would welcome suggestions for alternative approaches for valuing caregiver quality of life in this appraisal. The committee concluded that the ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with TA588 but neither the company's nor the ERG approach is ideal, so there is substantial uncertainty.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"End of life\" id=\"410-1-end-of-life\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"end-of-life\" data-heading-type=\"section\">End of life</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA\" id=\"410-1-it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"410-1-3.14\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.14</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg9\" target=\"_top\">guide to the methods of technology appraisal</a>. The company proposed that risdiplam met NICE's criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but did not make a case for meeting the criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. The committee accepted that risdiplam did not meet the end-of-life criteria in the type 2 and 3 population because, although risdiplam may provide a survival benefit, life expectancy was likely to be over 2 years. For type 1 SMA, the company noted that survival depends on the nature and extent of supportive care. This may vary by country, NHS trust, clinician, and the preferences of patients and their families. The median age of death or permanent respiratory support in published natural history studies was 9 months to 13 months. The ERG commented that mean survival in the company's model for people with type 1 SMA having best supportive care was 4.88 years but this was likely to be an overestimate because of the way the company had applied the hazard ratios in the model (see section 3.10). The committee noted that it usually prefers to assess whether this criterion is met by referring to the mean survival predicted by the model. However, it accepted the limitations of the model in this case mean that estimates from the literature are more robust. The committee recognised that the life expectancy is uncertain but considered it reasonable to accept that risdiplam could meet the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA\" id=\"410-1-it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"410-1-3.15\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.15</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Having concluded that the short life-expectancy criterion was met for type 1 SMA, the committee recalled that the long-term survival estimates for these patients are very uncertain (see section 3.9).

The committee noted that nusinersen (TA588) was considered to have met the criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but not for types 2 or 3.

Each standard consists of a prioritised set of specific, concise and measurable statements. NICE quality standards draw on existing NICE or NICE-accredited guidance that provides an underpinning, comprehensive set of recommendations, and are designed to support the measurement of improvement. </p>\r\n  <p>Expected levels of achievement for quality measures are not specified. Quality standards are intended to drive up the quality of care, and so achievement levels of 100% should be aspired to (or 0% if the quality statement states that something should not be done). However, this may not always be appropriate in practice. Taking account of safety, shared decision-making, choice and professional judgement, desired levels of achievement should be defined locally.</p>\r\n  <p>Information about <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/standards-and-indicators/timeline-developing-quality-standards\" target=\"_top\">how NICE quality standards are developed</a> is available from the NICE website.</p>\r\n  <p>See <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/Get-Involved/Meetings-in-public/Quality-Standards-Advisory-Committee\" target=\"_top\">quality standard advisory committees</a> on the website for details of standing committee 3 members who advised on this quality standard.

The committee used the evidence and their experience to agree other areas for discussion, including driving and possible issues with education and employment. They noted that schools, colleges and universities may sometimes question a diagnosis of ADHD and not understand how symptoms can affect daily functioning. In addition, healthcare professionals treating a coexisting condition may not be aware of how ADHD symptoms may affect behaviour (organisation and time management) and adherence to treatment.</p>\r\n      <p>There was evidence that parents of children with ADHD often feel a sense of isolation when attending parent-training programmes.

Evidence showed a clinically important benefit on some measures of symptoms of an ADHD-focused group parent-training programme for children under 5 years. There was limited evidence on the efficacy of medication, and because of concerns and lack of evidence about the long-term effects of medication in very young children, particularly in terms of growth and development, the committee agreed to recommend a group-based parent-training programme as first-line treatment. However, the committee agreed that untreated ADHD can have far-reaching, long-lasting negative impacts on a child's life and some children may still have a significant impairment after the programme and environmental modifications.

Evidence indicated that parents and carers of children aged 5 years and over and young people benefit from group support. After discussion of current good practice and consideration of the balance of benefits and costs, the committee decided to recommend offering limited group-based ADHD-focused support (may be as few as 1 or 2 sessions) for parents and carers of all children and young people with ADHD, alongside information and advice on environmental modifications.</p>\r\n      <p>Evidence showed the benefit of medication in this age group in improving ADHD symptoms and this was in line with the committee's experience. The committee acknowledged there are concerns about recommending medication for ADHD and particularly the uncertainty over the long-term adverse effects of medication in growing children. However, the committee agreed that untreated ADHD can have far-reaching, long-lasting negative impacts on a child or young person's life (for example, affecting academic performance, interpersonal relationships, work, personal issues, substance use and driving). Medication offers a better balance of benefits and costs than non-pharmacological interventions, so the committee agreed to recommend it when ADHD symptoms are persistent and still causing a significant impairment in at least one domain of everyday life despite the implementation and review of environmental modifications. The committee was aware of the implications of medication in this young population and made several recommendations to ensure its responsible use.

The committee agreed that this should be considered when a young person has benefited from medication but still has symptoms that are causing a significant impairment. They used their experience to recommend areas that a programme should address.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"How the recommendations might affect practice\" id=\"233-1-how-the-recommendations-might-affect-practice\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"how-the-recommendations-might-affect-practice\" data-heading-type=\"section\">How the recommendations might affect practice</h4>\r\n      <p>The 2018 recommendations ensure that parents and carers of all children and young people with ADHD receive group-based ADHD-focused support. This reinforces the retained 2008 recommendation that children seen in primary care with suspected ADHD and at least moderate impairment are offered group-based ADHD support. Both recommendations indicate that behavioural interventions come before medication in children with at least moderate impairment. In the 2018 recommendations, children and young people aged 5 years and over are offered medication by a healthcare professional with training and expertise in diagnosing and managing ADHD if symptoms are still causing a significant impairment in their everyday life despite environmental modifications and following discussion with the child or young person and their parents or carers. The recommendations make it clear that where symptoms can be addressed with behaviour interventions, children over 5 years and young people should not be offered medication.</p>\r\n      <p>The current categorisation of ADHD focuses on the presence of significant impairment across the different domains of everyday life, rather than using the previously used terms of mild, moderate and severe ADHD. There is considerable overlap with the guideline population described in the 2008 recommendation. The 2018 recommendations reflect current practice and are unlikely to result in a substantial increase in prescribing and resource use.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"informaltable\">\r\n        <table frame=\"all\" border=\"1\" id=\"ID0EEIAG\">\r\n          <thead />\r\n          <tbody>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>The committee's full discussion is in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng87/evidence/e-nonpharmacological-efficacy-and-adverse-events-pdf-4783686305\" target=\"_top\">evidence review E: non-pharmacological efficacy and adverse events</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng87/evidence/f-combination-treatment-pdf-4783686306\" target=\"_top\">evidence review F: combination treatment</a>.</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <a class=\"link\" href=\"_Children_aged_5\" target=\"_top\">Return to the recommendations</a>.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Managing ADHD – adults\" id=\"233-1-managing-adhd-adults\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"managing-adhd-adults\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Managing ADHD – adults</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <a class=\"link\" href=\"_Adults\" target=\"_top\">Recommendations 1.5.15 to 1.5.18</a>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Why the committee made the recommendations\" id=\"233-1-why-the-committee-made-the-recommendations\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"why-the-committee-made-the-recommendations\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Why the committee made the recommendations</h4>\r\n      <p>Evidence directly comparing medication with non-pharmacological treatment supported the use of medication for first-line treatment of ADHD in adults. The committee acknowledged there are concerns about recommending medication for ADHD and in particular the uncertainty over the long-term benefits and the adverse effects of medication. However, the committee agreed that untreated ADHD can have a negative impact on a person's life, with lower educational attainment, and higher criminality. So they agreed to recommend medication when ADHD symptoms are still causing a significant impairment in at least one domain of everyday life despite environmental modifications.</p>\r\n      <p>Evidence indicated a benefit of non-pharmacological treatment, although this was less than for medication. There was also evidence of the importance of offering a choice of treatments, so the committee agreed that non-pharmacological treatment should be considered for adults who have made an informed choice not to have medication, have difficulty adhering to medication or have found they cannot tolerate medication or it is ineffective. Based on their experience, the committee recommended that the treatment may include elements of or a full programme of CBT and should include a structured supportive psychological intervention focused on ADHD, with regular follow‑up and information.</p>\r\n      <p>Combining medication with non-pharmacological treatment did not offer the best balance of benefits and costs, so the committee decided that combination treatment should only be considered when medication has offered some benefit but symptoms continue to cause a significant impairment.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"How the recommendations might affect practice\" id=\"233-1-how-the-recommendations-might-affect-practice\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"how-the-recommendations-might-affect-practice\" data-heading-type=\"section\">How the recommendations might affect practice</h4>\r\n      <p>The recommendations reflect good current practice.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"informaltable\">\r\n        <table frame=\"all\" border=\"1\" id=\"ID0EQJAG\">\r\n          <thead />\r\n          <tbody>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>The committee's full discussion is in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng87/evidence/e-nonpharmacological-efficacy-and-adverse-events-pdf-4783686305\" target=\"_top\">evidence review E: non-pharmacological efficacy and adverse events</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng87/evidence/f-combination-treatment-pdf-4783686306\" target=\"_top\">evidence review F: combination treatment</a>.</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <a class=\"link\" href=\"_Adults\" target=\"_top\">Return to the recommendations</a>.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Medication – care arrangements\" id=\"233-1-medication-care-arrangements\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"medication-care-arrangements\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Medication – care arrangements</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <a class=\"link\" href=\"Medication\" target=\"_top\">Recommendations 1.7.2</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"_Shared_care_for\" target=\"_top\">1.7.29</a></p>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Why the committee made the recommendations\" id=\"233-1-why-the-committee-made-the-recommendations\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"why-the-committee-made-the-recommendations\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Why the committee made the recommendations</h4>\r\n      <p>The committee discussed the roles of different healthcare professionals in initiating, monitoring and reviewing medication.

The committee used the evidence, their experience and the drug licensing to recommend methylphenidate as a treatment for children aged 5 years and over and young people, and lisdexamfetamine or methylphenidate as a treatment for adults. </p>\r\n      <p>The committee acknowledged the rising cost of dexamfetamine since 2008 and agreed that it should only be considered when lisdexamfetamine is effective but the longer effect profile is not well tolerated.</p>\r\n      <p>The committee agreed that if methylphenidate has not been effective for children aged over 5 years and young people, then lisdexamfetamine could be considered.</p>\r\n      <p>Atomoxetine and guanfacine were the non-stimulant drugs with the most convincing evidence. The committee noted that atomoxetine is more widely used and that there was stronger evidence for a benefit of atomoxetine compared with placebo than guanfacine compared with placebo. One trial directly comparing atomoxetine with guanfacine generally showed a clinically important benefit of guanfacine. Taking into account the licensing status of these drugs and the familiarity of most healthcare professionals with them, the committee recommended that in children aged 5 years and over and young people, either drug could be offered after intolerance or a lack of response to stimulants (methylphenidate and lisdexamfetamine). Because guanfacine is not licensed for use in adults and there was no evidence specifically supporting its use in this population, the committee recommended atomoxetine for adults with intolerance or a lack of response to stimulants.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"section\" title=\"Further medication choices\" id=\"233-1-further-medication-choices\">\r\n        <h5 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"further-medication-choices\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Further medication choices</h5>\r\n        <p>There was not enough evidence to justify specific recommendations for other drugs so the committee recommended that after at least one stimulant and non-stimulant had been tried, healthcare professionals should obtain a second opinion or refer to a tertiary service.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"section\" title=\"Medication choice for people with coexisting conditions\" id=\"233-1-medication-choice-for-people-with-coexisting-conditions\">\r\n        <h5 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"medication-choice-for-people-with-coexisting-conditions\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Medication choice for people with coexisting conditions</h5>\r\n        <p>There was very little evidence on medication choice for people with ADHD and coexisting conditions and so the committee made research recommendations to address this gap. The committee agreed that neither the available evidence nor their experience justified a different choice of ADHD medication for people with ADHD and coexisting conditions, but there should be slower titration, more careful monitoring and recording of adverse effects, and regular weekly telephone contact. However, the committee recommended that ADHD medication should be stopped in people experiencing a psychotic episode because they agreed that ADHD medication could worsen psychotic symptoms.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"How the recommendations might affect practice\" id=\"233-1-how-the-recommendations-might-affect-practice\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"how-the-recommendations-might-affect-practice\" data-heading-type=\"section\">How the recommendations might affect practice</h4>\r\n      <p>The recommendations reflect good current practice.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"informaltable\">\r\n        <table frame=\"all\" border=\"1\" id=\"ID0E2NAG\">\r\n          <thead />\r\n          <tbody>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>The committee's full discussion is in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng87/evidence/c-pharmacological-efficacy-and-sequencing-pdf-4783686303\" target=\"_top\">evidence review C: pharmacological efficacy and sequencing</a>.</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <a class=\"link\" href=\"_Medication_choice_–_1\" target=\"_top\">Return to the recommendations</a>.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Medication – considerations when prescribing and dose titration\" id=\"233-1-medication-considerations-when-prescribing-and-dose-titration\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"medication-considerations-when-prescribing-and-dose-titration\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Medication – considerations when prescribing and dose titration</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <a class=\"link\" href=\"_Considerations_when_prescribing\" target=\"_top\">Recommendations 1.7.20 to 1.7.28</a>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Why the committee made the recommendations\" id=\"233-1-why-the-committee-made-the-recommendations\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"why-the-committee-made-the-recommendations\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Why the committee made the recommendations</h4>\r\n      <p>The committee discussed that the careful initiation of ADHD medication is key to a successful treatment plan.

How long may vary from guideline to guideline, and depends on how much change in practice or services is needed. Implementing change is most effective when aligned with local priorities.</p>\r\n  <p>Changes recommended for clinical practice that can be done quickly – like changes in prescribing practice – should be shared quickly. This is because healthcare professionals should use guidelines to guide their work – as is required by professional regulating bodies such as the General Medical and Nursing and Midwifery Councils.</p>\r\n  <p>Changes should be implemented as soon as possible, unless there is a good reason for not doing so (for example, if it would be better value for money if a package of recommendations were all implemented at once).</p>\r\n  <p>Different organisations may need different approaches to implementation, depending on their size and function. Sometimes individual practitioners may be able to respond to recommendations to improve their practice more quickly than large organisations.</p>\r\n  <p>Here are some pointers to help organisations put NICE guidelines into practice:</p>\r\n  <p>1. <strong>Raise awareness</strong> through routine communication channels, such as email or newsletters, regular meetings, internal staff briefings and other communications with all relevant partner organisations. Identify things staff can include in their own practice straight away. </p>\r\n  <p>2. <strong>Identify a lead</strong> with an interest in the topic to champion the guideline and motivate others to support its use and make service changes, and to find out any significant issues locally.</p>\r\n  <p>3. <strong>Carry out a baseline assessment</strong> against the recommendations to find out whether there are gaps in current service provision. </p>\r\n  <p>4. <strong>Think about what data you need to measure improvement</strong> and plan how you will collect it. You may want to work with other health and social care organisations and specialist groups to compare current practice with the recommendations. This may also help identify local issues that will slow or prevent implementation. </p>\r\n  <p>5. <strong>Develop an action plan</strong>, with the steps needed to put the guideline into practice, and make sure it is ready as soon as possible. Big, complex changes may take longer to implement, but some may be quick and easy to do. An action plan will help in both cases. </p>\r\n  <p>6. <strong>For very big changes</strong> include milestones and a business case, which will set out additional costs, savings and possible areas for disinvestment. A small project group could develop the action plan. The group might include the guideline champion, a senior organisational sponsor, staff involved in the associated services, finance and information professionals.</p>\r\n  <p>7. <strong>Implement the action plan</strong> with oversight from the lead and the project group. Big projects may also need project management support.</p>\r\n  <p>8. <strong>Review and monitor</strong> how well the guideline is being implemented through the project group. Share progress with those involved in making improvements, as well as relevant boards and local partners. </p>\r\n  <p>NICE provides a comprehensive programme of support and resources to maximise uptake and use of evidence and guidance.

The diagnosis is made on the basis of observed and reported behavioural symptoms. Two main diagnostic systems are in current use, the International Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders 10th revision (ICD‑10) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM‑5). Both systems require that symptoms are present in several settings such as school/work, home life and leisure activities. Symptoms should be evident in early life, if only in retrospect; for ICD‑10, by age 7 years and for DSM‑5, by age 12 years. ADHD may persist into adult life.</p>\r\n  <p>Prevalence rates for ICD‑10 (identifying hyperkinetic disorder) are 1 to 2% in childhood. Under the previous, less stringent DSM‑IV criteria, childhood prevalence rates were 3 to 9% and these may increase under the new DSM‑5 criteria.</p>\r\n  <p>The causes of ADHD are not fully understood but a number of risk factors are associated with the condition. Genetic factors can have an influence, with family members frequently affected. The diagnosis of ADHD in older family members such as parents may have previously been missed and should be considered.</p>\r\n  <p>Both the ICD‑10 and DSM‑5 require the presence of functional impairment due to symptoms of ADHD, with the symptoms adversely affecting psychological, social and/or educational/occupational functioning. The impact of ADHD may vary considerably in its severity, which is best judged by considering the level of impairment, pervasiveness, and familial and social context. For some people, symptoms may be limited to certain settings and cause minimal impairment in a limited number of domains (for example, ability to complete schoolwork, work tasks, avoiding common hazards and forming positive interpersonal relationships). In other people, multiple symptom areas (hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity) are present in multiple settings, and this causes significant impairment across multiple domains. Symptoms and impact can also change over time. For some people, symptoms and impairment may be reduced through environmental modifications, such as a modified school curriculum or choice of employment. </p>\r\n  <p>Symptoms of ADHD can overlap with those of other related disorders. Therefore, care in differential diagnosis is needed. ADHD may also coexist with other disorders. Common coexisting conditions in children include disorders of mood, conduct, learning, motor control, language and communication, and anxiety disorders; in adults, they include personality disorders, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and substance misuse. Where there are coexisting conditions, it is important to try to differentiate the level of impairment due to ADHD, because this will guide the treatment plan. In addition, ADHD is under-recognised in some populations, which can mean that a lack of appropriate diagnosis and treatment adversely affects people's quality of life.</p>\r\n  <p>The aim of this guideline is to raise awareness of populations at risk and to provide clear advice on managing ADHD. </p>\r\n  <p>The guideline covers children under 5 years, children and young people aged 5 to 17 years, and adults aged 18 years or over who are at risk of ADHD or have a diagnosis of ADHD. The guideline covers all primary, secondary and community care settings in which NHS-funded care is provided for people with ADHD. </p>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"More information\" id=\"233-1-more-information\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"more-information\" data-heading-type=\"section\">More information</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"informaltable\">\r\n      <table frame=\"all\" border=\"1\" id=\"ID0EEWAG\">\r\n        <thead />\r\n        <tbody>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td>\r\n              <p>To find out what NICE has said on topics related to this guideline, see our web page on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/conditions-and-diseases/mental-health-and-behavioural-conditions/mental-health-and-behavioural-conditions--general-and-other\" target=\"_top\">mental health and behavioural conditions</a>. </p>\r\n            </td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n        </tbody>\r\n      </table>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>",

Clinical evidence shows that risdiplam improves motor function in SMA types 1 to 3. Also, there is some evidence suggesting that people with type 1 SMA who have risdiplam live for longer. But there is no direct evidence comparing risdiplam with best supportive care for type 1 SMA. And there is no long-term evidence, so the estimated long-term benefits are highly uncertain.</p>\r\n  <p>The committee considered a wide range of issues in its decision-making. In particular, it discussed the rarity and severity of SMA, risdiplam's innovative oral administration, uncertainties in the evidence, and whether risdiplam should be considered as an end-of-life treatment.</p>\r\n  <p>The cost-effectiveness estimates presented are much higher than what NICE usually considers an acceptable use of NHS resources. So, even taking these other factors into account, risdiplam cannot currently be recommended.</p>\r\n</div>",

People with the condition have a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, and have worsening physical disability, mobility loss and respiratory dysfunction. SMA can be grouped into 5 main types (0 to 4), based on the age of onset and the maximum motor function reached. SMA type 0, the most severe, affects babies before birth. The babies do not develop any motor skills and often survive for only a few weeks after birth. Babies with type 1 SMA are unable to sit or roll because of severe muscle weakness, which gets worse over time. The muscle weakness also affects swallowing and breathing, and typically results in death within 2 years if respiratory support is not used. In type 2 SMA, the onset of symptoms is between 7 months and 18 months. People with this condition can sit independently at diagnosis. However, progressive loss of motor function means they have a reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. In type 3 SMA, there are varying degrees of muscle weakness, which appear between 18 months and 18 years. People with this condition can have a normal lifespan, and walk or sit unaided at some point, but many lose mobility and other functions over time. Type 4 SMA is the least severe and affects adults, who may have milder motor impairment and live a normal lifespan. The clinical experts explained that type 0 and type 4 SMA are rarely diagnosed in clinical practice in the NHS in England. The patient experts explained that SMA is a progressive disorder so all patients will experience more severe symptoms over time. The committee concluded that SMA is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disorder that affects all aspects of daily life.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam\" id=\"412-1-the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"412-1-3.2\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.2</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The patient experts commented that the SMA classification system does not always reflect the full extent of the disease. The boundaries between the different SMA types are blurred and can be subjective. They also explained that it was not originally intended to define populations who were eligible for treatment. One patient expert with a child with type 3 SMA described how progressive loss of motor function has affected all daily activities and being unable to access treatments such as nusinersen has a big effect on physical and mental health. The committee understood that risdiplam's marketing authorisation includes types 1 to 3 SMA as currently defined by the SMA classification system and these definitions were also used in the clinical evidence (see section 3.5). The committee acknowledged the limitations of the current SMA classification system but concluded that it had been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families\" id=\"412-1-sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\" data-heading-type=\"section\">SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"412-1-3.3\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.3</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The clinical and patient experts explained that most people with SMA need constant support. This can include full-time care and attention, needing physical effort (such as lifting and carrying) and causing loss of sleep for patients and carers, stress, and fear about loss of abilities. One patient expert with a child with type 2 SMA described how living with the condition can put considerable strain on relationships with other family members and friends. Siblings have a restricted social circle because of the fear of respiratory infections, and often act as young carers. As well as dealing with the physical and mental stress as the condition progresses, the financial burden also increases as more supportive equipment is needed. Another patient expert with type 2 SMA described the fear of losing fine motor skills and how being unable to work would affect the whole family. All these factors have a large effect on family members' health-related quality of life. The patient experts emphasised how caring for people with SMA affects the whole family and can cause physical, mental and financial issues. The committee concluded that SMA has a substantial effect on the quality of life of patients, caregivers and their families.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Comparator\" id=\"412-1-comparator\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"comparator\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Comparator</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam\" id=\"412-1-best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"412-1-3.4\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.4</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Nusinersen is the only disease-modifying treatment currently available for SMA. The clinical and patient experts explained that many people with SMA have spinal fusion so cannot have nusinersen because it is delivered by intrathecal injection and requires access to the lower spine. They commented that an oral treatment option would be welcome and would also address several issues related to the delivery of nusinersen including the use of sedation, radiographic imaging and anxiety associated with lumbar puncture. Nusinersen is recommended in NICE's guidance TA588 through a managed access agreement. This makes nusinersen available while more data is collected. However, nusinersen is not routinely commissioned in the NHS in England. So, current treatment for many people is best supportive care. The aim is to control symptoms, maintain movement and function for as long as possible and improve quality of life. This involves a multidisciplinary approach including respiratory, gastroenterology and orthopaedic care, as well as nutritional support, physiotherapy, assistive technologies, occupational therapy and social care. However, the clinical and patient experts emphasised that these supportive treatments do not affect disease progression, so people with SMA will ultimately become dependent on their families and carers. The committee was aware of an ongoing highly specialised technology evaluation for <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-hst10026\" target=\"_top\">onasemnogene abeparvovec for treating spinal muscular atrophy type 1</a>. It was aware that this treatment was recommended in draft guidance for routine commissioning for some babies 12 months or younger with SMA type 1. However, it understood that the guidance was not final and therefore onasemnogene abeparvovec could not be included as a comparator. The NHS England commissioning expert described the potential treatment pathway if risdiplam were to be recommended as a treatment option alongside nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec. They explained that repeated treatment switching would only be expected in exceptional circumstances, related to issues such as fertility or side effects. The committee recognised that treatment options used routinely in the NHS in England are currently limited and there is an unmet need for people with SMA. It recalled that best supportive care is routinely used in clinical practice in the NHS in England. It concluded that best supportive care was the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Clinical evidence\" id=\"412-1-clinical-evidence\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"clinical-evidence\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Clinical evidence</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3\" id=\"412-1-evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"412-1-3.5\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.5</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The main clinical effectiveness evidence for risdiplam came from 2 clinical studies:</p>\r\n          <ul class=\"itemizedlist indented\">\r\n            <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n              <p>SUNFISH, which is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre (excluding UK sites), phase 2, placebo-controlled trial.

RAINBOWFISH is a phase 2, single-arm study of babies 6 weeks or younger who had been genetically diagnosed with SMA but did not have symptoms. JEWELFISH is an open-label, single-arm study for SMA types 1, 2 and 3 in people of 6 months to 60 years who had previously enrolled in the MOONFISH study or who had previously had nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec or olesoxime. The ERG considered that although SUNFISH excluded patients with type 3 SMA who could walk, this group accounts for a small proportion of SMA cases. It also noted that SUNFISH and FIREFISH excluded patients who had previous treatment (see section 3.6). The committee noted the age restrictions used in both studies. It was aware that some babies may be diagnosed with type 1 SMA when they are older than 7 months. The clinical experts explained that the study populations were generally representative of patients with SMA in the NHS in England. The committee concluded that the evidence presented for SMA types 1 to 3 was suitable for decision making.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen\" id=\"412-1-there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\" data-heading-type=\"section\">There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"412-1-3.6\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.6</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The company did not present any clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for people who have had nusinersen.

The company stated that there is no plausible biological rationale to expect the treatment effect to differ based on prior treatment because both nusinersen and risdiplam have a similar mechanism of action (they are both SMN2 RNA splicing modifiers). The committee recalled that some people who have had nusinersen may have preferred not to have it but it was the only option available (see section 3.4).

The results from FIREFISH were compared against pre-defined performance criteria, based on natural history data for patients with type 1 SMA. The results (see table 2) suggest that after 12 months of treatment with risdiplam, more patients were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds than would be expected for patients with type 1 SMA. Overall survival was 93% (90% confidence interval 82.2% to 97.1%). After technical engagement, both the company and the ERG used the company's matched adjusted indirect comparison to model the treatment effect of risdiplam compared with best supportive care for type 1 SMA. The indirect comparison showed improvements in motor function (such as sitting with and without support), ventilation-free survival and overall survival (the company considers the data to be confidential so it cannot be reported here). The company and the ERG agreed that improvements seen in both SUNFISH and FIREFISH were clinically important. The patient experts described their experiences of using risdiplam and noted improvements in motor function, lung capacity, energy levels and stamina. They explained that even very small improvements in fine motor skills and upper limb function were very important because they allow patients to maintain independence.

Both models compared risdiplam with best supportive care. Health-state transitions were based on assessments of motor milestones using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Module 2 for type 1 SMA, and the 32 item Motor Function Measure and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. In the type 1 model, the ERG noted that the company's approach overestimates overall survival in the best supportive care arm. It stated that the company should have applied the hazard ratio to the best supportive care group instead of applying the inverse of the hazard ratio to the risdiplam group. After technical engagement, the company added a treatment-effect plateau similar to that used in TA588. The plateau assumed patients who have had risdiplam will not reach additional motor milestones after 66 months for SMA type 1 and 26 months for SMA type 2 or 3. The ERG explained that the company's models were broadly consistent with the final model used in TA588 but there were differences in the stopping rule and caregiver assumptions (see sections 0 and 3.13).

This restricted its use to a maximum of 50 years for type 1 SMA and 30 years for types 2 and 3 SMA. The committee noted that this approach differed to the stopping criteria in TA588, which was based on clinical outcomes including repeated loss of motor function, the need for ventilation and scoliosis. Clinical advice to the company suggested that a time-based rule may be easy to implement in the NHS in England and may be preferred to the current criteria set out in TA588 because it would avoid pressure for continuous motor milestone improvement. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the current stopping rules in TA588 were problematic and put undue strain on patients and their caregivers. The clinical expert suggested that a maximum treatment duration of 50 years would be reasonable for type 1 SMA, but 30 years may not be appropriate for types 2 and 3. This is because many adults may still benefit from risdiplam and it would be unfair to stop treatment for these people. The ERG preferred not to include the company's time-based stopping rule because it was not based on any evidence. But it noted that a stopping rule based on clinical criteria may improve risdiplam's cost-effectiveness. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the stopping rule used in TA588 is challenging to implement in clinical practice. So, the committee considered that appropriate stopping criteria should be explored in collaboration with clinical and patient experts and the wider SMA community. It was aware that there is ongoing work reviewing the TA588 stopping criteria for nusinersen and agreed that this could also be relevant for risdiplam. In the absence of updated criteria from TA588, the committee concluded that the company's stopping rules may not be appropriate and it would like to see stopping rules based on clinical criteria that have been agreed with clinical and patient experts.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Utility values\" id=\"412-1-utility-values\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"utility-values\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Utility values</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger\" id=\"412-1-the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"412-1-3.12\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.12</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>After technical engagement, the company included in its base case an additional utility gain to reflect risdiplam's potential benefits in fine motor skills. The company applied a utility gain of 0.05 and 0.10 for patients treated with risdiplam in the non-sitting and sitting health states respectively, based on Thokala et al. (2010). The ERG preferred to exclude these additional utility gains for fine motor skills because:</p>\r\n          <ul class=\"itemizedlist indented\">\r\n            <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n              <p>the values were based on assumptions rather than evidence</p>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n              <p>there was uncertainty around how many patients treated with risdiplam would have these utility gains</p>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n              <p>there was uncertainty around the duration of any utility gains.</p>\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n      <p>The patient experts described the importance of maintaining upper limb function because it allows independence. They explained that some benefits were not captured in the available motor function scales because even small improvements were highly valued by patients and made a large difference to health-related quality of life. The committee was sympathetic to these arguments and noted that SUNFISH showed improvements in upper limb function at 12 months and also in the SMA independence scale (see table 1). It concluded that the company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with NICE's appraisal of nusinersen but there is substantial uncertainty\" id=\"412-1-the-ergs-approach-to-including-caregiver-utility-values-is-consistent-with-nices-appraisal-of-nusinersen-but-there-is-substantial-uncertainty\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-ergs-approach-to-including-caregiver-utility-values-is-consistent-with-nices-appraisal-of-nusinersen-but-there-is-substantial-uncertainty\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with NICE's appraisal of nusinersen but there is substantial uncertainty</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"412-1-3.13\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.13</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Both the company and ERG included caregiver-related utility values but their approaches differed. The company used an additive approach and assumed that caregiver health-related quality of life increased linearly with each motor milestone that was met. The ERG explained that the company's additive approach assumed that after a patient died the caregiver health-related quality of life was zero. This increased the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains for risdiplam because patients live longer. The ERG did not think this was appropriate because it assumed society places value on caregivers of surviving patients with SMA but does not for bereaved caregivers. Submissions at technical engagement from patient and professional organisations emphasised that bereavement would have a significant and sustained effect on a caregiver's health-related quality of life. After technical engagement, the ERG presented its preferred analysis and 2 scenario analyses that explored the effects of bereavement. It preferred to apply a disutility (reduction in health-related quality of life) that was linked to the health state of the patient with SMA. But in the base case, after the patient died, the caregiver utility value was assumed to return to that of the general population. In the first scenario, the ERG applied a disutility of -0.04 from Song et al. (2010) for 20 years after the patient with SMA died and in the second scenario the same disutility was applied for the maximum time horizon (90 years). The ERG cautioned that the analyses were limited because they used arbitrary assumptions and the company's model did not include caregiver ageing or survival. The committee understood that the ERG's disutility approach was consistent with TA588 and was not aware of any previous technology appraisals that used the company's preferred additive approach to model caregiver utility values. It also noted that while the guide to the methods of technology evaluation states that when relevant, direct health effects for carers can be included in analyses, it is unclear whether this extends to valuing caregiver bereavement. It recalled that SMA has a substantial effect on carers and families as well as patients and can affect multiple members of the extended family (see section 3.3). It was aware that using the ERG's preferred disutility approach substantially increased the cost-effectiveness ratios, particularly for type 1 SMA. This was because the substantial caregiver disutilities were subtracted from the patient utility values, which themselves reflect a poor quality of life. So increased survival results in a low number of QALYs, but at a high extra cost. This was less of an issue for type 2 and type 3 SMA because the additional survival is associated with higher patient utility and lower carer disutility than in the type 1 model, meaning a higher number of QALYs can be accrued. The company noted that this was counterintuitive because it made a life-extending treatment appear to be less cost effective. It also noted that using the ERG's approach meant that risdiplam was not cost effective, even when there was no cost for risdiplam. The ERG explained that the cost-effectiveness of risdiplam was related to other factors including extended overall survival and high disease management costs. Also, the committee understood that the company preferred to assume each patient with SMA would have 2.2 caregivers. However, the ERG preferred to assume 3 caregivers for patients with type 2 or 3 SMA who cannot sit because this is consistent with TA588. The committee did not accept the company's approach to caregiver utility but recognised the difficulties in valuing caregiver utility values. It noted that the ERG approach also had limitations and resulted in particularly high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for type 1 SMA. Despite accepting the logic of the ERG's modelling, it did not agree that including carer quality of life would result in fewer QALYs being accrued by carers when risdiplam extends survival.  Therefore, it would welcome suggestions for alternative approaches for valuing caregiver quality of life in this appraisal. The committee concluded that the ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with TA588 but neither the company's nor the ERG approach is ideal, so there is substantial uncertainty.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"End of life\" id=\"412-1-end-of-life\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"end-of-life\" data-heading-type=\"section\">End of life</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA\" id=\"412-1-it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"412-1-3.14\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.14</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg9\" target=\"_top\">guide to the methods of technology appraisal</a>. The company proposed that risdiplam met NICE's criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but did not make a case for meeting the criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. The committee accepted that risdiplam did not meet the end-of-life criteria in the type 2 and 3 population because, although risdiplam may provide a survival benefit, life expectancy was likely to be over 2 years. For type 1 SMA, the company noted that survival depends on the nature and extent of supportive care. This may vary by country, NHS trust, clinician, and the preferences of patients and their families. The median age of death or permanent respiratory support in published natural history studies was 9 months to 13 months. The ERG commented that mean survival in the company's model for people with type 1 SMA having best supportive care was 4.88 years but this was likely to be an overestimate because of the way the company had applied the hazard ratios in the model (see section 3.10). The committee noted that it usually prefers to assess whether this criterion is met by referring to the mean survival predicted by the model. However, it accepted the limitations of the model in this case mean that estimates from the literature are more robust. The committee recognised that the life expectancy is uncertain but considered it reasonable to accept that risdiplam could meet the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA\" id=\"412-1-it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"412-1-3.15\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.15</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Having concluded that the short life-expectancy criterion was met for type 1 SMA, the committee recalled that the long-term survival estimates for these patients are very uncertain (see section 3.9).

The committee noted that nusinersen (TA588) was considered to have met the criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but not for types 2 or 3.

People with the condition have a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, and have worsening physical disability, mobility loss and respiratory dysfunction. SMA can be grouped into 5 main types (0 to 4), based on the age of onset and the maximum motor function reached. SMA type 0, the most severe, affects babies before birth. The babies do not develop any motor skills and often survive for only a few weeks after birth. Babies with type 1 SMA are unable to sit or roll because of severe muscle weakness, which gets worse over time. The muscle weakness also affects swallowing and breathing, and typically results in death within 2 years if respiratory support is not used. In type 2 SMA, the onset of symptoms is between 7 months and 18 months. People with this condition can sit independently at diagnosis. However, progressive loss of motor function means they have a reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. In type 3 SMA, there are varying degrees of muscle weakness, which appear between 18 months and 18 years. People with this condition can have a normal lifespan, and walk or sit unaided at some point, but many lose mobility and other functions over time. Type 4 SMA is the least severe and affects adults, who may have milder motor impairment and live a normal lifespan. The clinical experts explained that type 0 and type 4 SMA are rarely diagnosed in clinical practice in the NHS in England. The patient experts explained that SMA is a progressive disorder so all patients will experience more severe symptoms over time. The committee concluded that SMA is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disorder that affects all aspects of daily life.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam\" id=\"596-1-the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"596-1-3.2\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.2</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The patient experts commented that the SMA classification system does not always reflect the full extent of the disease. The boundaries between the different SMA types are blurred and can be subjective. They also explained that it was not originally intended to define populations who were eligible for treatment. One patient expert with a child with type 3 SMA described how progressive loss of motor function has affected all daily activities and being unable to access treatments such as nusinersen has a big effect on physical and mental health. The committee understood that risdiplam's marketing authorisation includes types 1 to 3 SMA as currently defined by the SMA classification system and these definitions were also used in the clinical evidence (see section 3.5). The committee acknowledged the limitations of the current SMA classification system but concluded that it had been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families\" id=\"596-1-sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\" data-heading-type=\"section\">SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"596-1-3.3\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.3</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The clinical and patient experts explained that most people with SMA need constant support. This can include full-time care and attention, needing physical effort (such as lifting and carrying) and causing loss of sleep for patients and carers, stress, and fear about loss of abilities. One patient expert with a child with type 2 SMA described how living with the condition can put considerable strain on relationships with other family members and friends. Siblings have a restricted social circle because of the fear of respiratory infections, and often act as young carers. As well as dealing with the physical and mental stress as the condition progresses, the financial burden also increases as more supportive equipment is needed. Another patient expert with type 2 SMA described the fear of losing fine motor skills and how being unable to work would affect the whole family. All these factors have a large effect on family members' health-related quality of life. The patient experts emphasised how caring for people with SMA affects the whole family and can cause physical, mental and financial issues. The committee concluded that SMA has a substantial effect on the quality of life of patients, caregivers and their families.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Comparator\" id=\"596-1-comparator\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"comparator\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Comparator</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam\" id=\"596-1-best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"596-1-3.4\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.4</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Nusinersen is the only disease-modifying treatment currently available for SMA. The clinical and patient experts explained that many people with SMA have spinal fusion so cannot have nusinersen because it is delivered by intrathecal injection and requires access to the lower spine. They commented that an oral treatment option would be welcome and would also address several issues related to the delivery of nusinersen including the use of sedation, radiographic imaging and anxiety associated with lumbar puncture. Nusinersen is recommended in NICE's guidance TA588 through a managed access agreement. This makes nusinersen available while more data is collected. However, nusinersen is not routinely commissioned in the NHS in England. So, current treatment for many people is best supportive care. The aim is to control symptoms, maintain movement and function for as long as possible and improve quality of life. This involves a multidisciplinary approach including respiratory, gastroenterology and orthopaedic care, as well as nutritional support, physiotherapy, assistive technologies, occupational therapy and social care. However, the clinical and patient experts emphasised that these supportive treatments do not affect disease progression, so people with SMA will ultimately become dependent on their families and carers. The committee was aware of an ongoing highly specialised technology evaluation for <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-hst10026\" target=\"_top\">onasemnogene abeparvovec for treating spinal muscular atrophy type 1</a>. It was aware that this treatment was recommended in draft guidance for routine commissioning for some babies 12 months or younger with SMA type 1. However, it understood that the guidance was not final and therefore onasemnogene abeparvovec could not be included as a comparator. The NHS England commissioning expert described the potential treatment pathway if risdiplam were to be recommended as a treatment option alongside nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec. They explained that repeated treatment switching would only be expected in exceptional circumstances, related to issues such as fertility or side effects. The committee recognised that treatment options used routinely in the NHS in England are currently limited and there is an unmet need for people with SMA. It recalled that best supportive care is routinely used in clinical practice in the NHS in England. It concluded that best supportive care was the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Clinical evidence\" id=\"596-1-clinical-evidence\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"clinical-evidence\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Clinical evidence</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3\" id=\"596-1-evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"596-1-3.5\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.5</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The main clinical effectiveness evidence for risdiplam came from 2 clinical studies:</p>\r\n          <ul class=\"itemizedlist indented\">\r\n            <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n              <p>SUNFISH, which is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre (excluding UK sites), phase 2, placebo-controlled trial.

The ERG considered that although SUNFISH excluded patients with type 3 SMA who could walk, this group accounts for a small proportion of SMA cases. It also noted that SUNFISH and FIREFISH excluded patients who had previous treatment (see section 3.6). The committee noted the age restrictions used in both studies. It was aware that some babies may be diagnosed with type 1 SMA when they are older than 7 months. The clinical experts explained that the study populations were generally representative of patients with SMA in the NHS in England. The committee concluded that the evidence presented for SMA types 1 to 3 was suitable for decision making.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen\" id=\"596-1-there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\" data-heading-type=\"section\">There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"596-1-3.6\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.6</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The company did not present any clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for people who have had nusinersen.

The results from FIREFISH were compared against pre-defined performance criteria, based on natural history data for patients with type 1 SMA. The results (see table 2) suggest that after 12 months of treatment with risdiplam, more patients were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds than would be expected for patients with type 1 SMA. Overall survival was 93% (90% confidence interval 82.2% to 97.1%). After technical engagement, both the company and the ERG used the company's matched adjusted indirect comparison to model the treatment effect of risdiplam compared with best supportive care for type 1 SMA. The indirect comparison showed improvements in motor function (such as sitting with and without support), ventilation-free survival and overall survival (the company considers the data to be confidential so it cannot be reported here). The company and the ERG agreed that improvements seen in both SUNFISH and FIREFISH were clinically important. The patient experts described their experiences of using risdiplam and noted improvements in motor function, lung capacity, energy levels and stamina. They explained that even very small improvements in fine motor skills and upper limb function were very important because they allow patients to maintain independence. They emphasised that although the studies showed improvements in motor function, they would also highly value a treatment that keeps the disease stable and stops it getting worse. The committee agreed that the clinical evidence showed improved motor function with risdiplam but noted that overall survival data were only available for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n      <div class=\"informaltable\">\r\n        <table frame=\"all\" border=\"1\" id=\"ID0E2F\">\r\n          <caption>\r\n            <strong>Table 1 Results from SUNFISH for SMA types 2 and 3 at 12‑month follow up</strong>\r\n          </caption>\r\n          <thead>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Outcome</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Risdiplam n=120 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Placebo n=60 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Difference, risdiplam minus placebo (95% CI)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>p-value</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </thead>\r\n          <tbody>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>MFM-32 total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.36 (0.38)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.19 (0.52) </p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.55 (0.30 to 2.81)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02*, 0.02**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>HFMSE total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.95 (0.33)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.37 (0.46)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.58 (–0.53 to 1.69)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.30**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>RULM total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.61 (0.31)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02 (0.43)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.59 (0.55 to 2.62)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.05*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Caregiver-reported SMAIS score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.65 (0.50)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.91 (0.67)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>2.55 (0.93 to 4.17)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Patient-reported SMAIS total score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.04 (0.65)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.40 (0.86)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.45 (–0.68 to 3.57)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.18</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>Table note: All data are least squares mean change from baseline.

Both models compared risdiplam with best supportive care. Health-state transitions were based on assessments of motor milestones using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Module 2 for type 1 SMA, and the 32 item Motor Function Measure and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. In the type 1 model, the ERG noted that the company's approach overestimates overall survival in the best supportive care arm. It stated that the company should have applied the hazard ratio to the best supportive care group instead of applying the inverse of the hazard ratio to the risdiplam group. After technical engagement, the company added a treatment-effect plateau similar to that used in TA588. The plateau assumed patients who have had risdiplam will not reach additional motor milestones after 66 months for SMA type 1 and 26 months for SMA type 2 or 3. The ERG explained that the company's models were broadly consistent with the final model used in TA588 but there were differences in the stopping rule and caregiver assumptions (see sections 0 and 3.13).

This restricted its use to a maximum of 50 years for type 1 SMA and 30 years for types 2 and 3 SMA. The committee noted that this approach differed to the stopping criteria in TA588, which was based on clinical outcomes including repeated loss of motor function, the need for ventilation and scoliosis. Clinical advice to the company suggested that a time-based rule may be easy to implement in the NHS in England and may be preferred to the current criteria set out in TA588 because it would avoid pressure for continuous motor milestone improvement. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the current stopping rules in TA588 were problematic and put undue strain on patients and their caregivers. The clinical expert suggested that a maximum treatment duration of 50 years would be reasonable for type 1 SMA, but 30 years may not be appropriate for types 2 and 3. This is because many adults may still benefit from risdiplam and it would be unfair to stop treatment for these people. The ERG preferred not to include the company's time-based stopping rule because it was not based on any evidence. But it noted that a stopping rule based on clinical criteria may improve risdiplam's cost-effectiveness. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the stopping rule used in TA588 is challenging to implement in clinical practice. So, the committee considered that appropriate stopping criteria should be explored in collaboration with clinical and patient experts and the wider SMA community. It was aware that there is ongoing work reviewing the TA588 stopping criteria for nusinersen and agreed that this could also be relevant for risdiplam. In the absence of updated criteria from TA588, the committee concluded that the company's stopping rules may not be appropriate and it would like to see stopping rules based on clinical criteria that have been agreed with clinical and patient experts.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Utility values\" id=\"596-1-utility-values\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"utility-values\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Utility values</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger\" id=\"596-1-the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"596-1-3.12\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.12</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>After technical engagement, the company included in its base case an additional utility gain to reflect risdiplam's potential benefits in fine motor skills. The company applied a utility gain of 0.05 and 0.10 for patients treated with risdiplam in the non-sitting and sitting health states respectively, based on Thokala et al. (2010).

The committee was sympathetic to these arguments and noted that SUNFISH showed improvements in upper limb function at 12 months and also in the SMA independence scale (see table 1). It concluded that the company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with NICE's appraisal of nusinersen but there is substantial uncertainty\" id=\"596-1-the-ergs-approach-to-including-caregiver-utility-values-is-consistent-with-nices-appraisal-of-nusinersen-but-there-is-substantial-uncertainty\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-ergs-approach-to-including-caregiver-utility-values-is-consistent-with-nices-appraisal-of-nusinersen-but-there-is-substantial-uncertainty\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with NICE's appraisal of nusinersen but there is substantial uncertainty</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"596-1-3.13\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.13</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Both the company and ERG included caregiver-related utility values but their approaches differed. The company used an additive approach and assumed that caregiver health-related quality of life increased linearly with each motor milestone that was met. The ERG explained that the company's additive approach assumed that after a patient died the caregiver health-related quality of life was zero. This increased the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains for risdiplam because patients live longer. The ERG did not think this was appropriate because it assumed society places value on caregivers of surviving patients with SMA but does not for bereaved caregivers. Submissions at technical engagement from patient and professional organisations emphasised that bereavement would have a significant and sustained effect on a caregiver's health-related quality of life. After technical engagement, the ERG presented its preferred analysis and 2 scenario analyses that explored the effects of bereavement. It preferred to apply a disutility (reduction in health-related quality of life) that was linked to the health state of the patient with SMA. But in the base case, after the patient died, the caregiver utility value was assumed to return to that of the general population. In the first scenario, the ERG applied a disutility of -0.04 from Song et al. (2010) for 20 years after the patient with SMA died and in the second scenario the same disutility was applied for the maximum time horizon (90 years). The ERG cautioned that the analyses were limited because they used arbitrary assumptions and the company's model did not include caregiver ageing or survival. The committee understood that the ERG's disutility approach was consistent with TA588 and was not aware of any previous technology appraisals that used the company's preferred additive approach to model caregiver utility values. It also noted that while the guide to the methods of technology evaluation states that when relevant, direct health effects for carers can be included in analyses, it is unclear whether this extends to valuing caregiver bereavement. It recalled that SMA has a substantial effect on carers and families as well as patients and can affect multiple members of the extended family (see section 3.3). It was aware that using the ERG's preferred disutility approach substantially increased the cost-effectiveness ratios, particularly for type 1 SMA. This was because the substantial caregiver disutilities were subtracted from the patient utility values, which themselves reflect a poor quality of life. So increased survival results in a low number of QALYs, but at a high extra cost. This was less of an issue for type 2 and type 3 SMA because the additional survival is associated with higher patient utility and lower carer disutility than in the type 1 model, meaning a higher number of QALYs can be accrued. The company noted that this was counterintuitive because it made a life-extending treatment appear to be less cost effective. It also noted that using the ERG's approach meant that risdiplam was not cost effective, even when there was no cost for risdiplam. The ERG explained that the cost-effectiveness of risdiplam was related to other factors including extended overall survival and high disease management costs. Also, the committee understood that the company preferred to assume each patient with SMA would have 2.2 caregivers. However, the ERG preferred to assume 3 caregivers for patients with type 2 or 3 SMA who cannot sit because this is consistent with TA588. The committee did not accept the company's approach to caregiver utility but recognised the difficulties in valuing caregiver utility values. It noted that the ERG approach also had limitations and resulted in particularly high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for type 1 SMA. Despite accepting the logic of the ERG's modelling, it did not agree that including carer quality of life would result in fewer QALYs being accrued by carers when risdiplam extends survival.  Therefore, it would welcome suggestions for alternative approaches for valuing caregiver quality of life in this appraisal. The committee concluded that the ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with TA588 but neither the company's nor the ERG approach is ideal, so there is substantial uncertainty.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"End of life\" id=\"596-1-end-of-life\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"end-of-life\" data-heading-type=\"section\">End of life</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA\" id=\"596-1-it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"596-1-3.14\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.14</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg9\" target=\"_top\">guide to the methods of technology appraisal</a>. The company proposed that risdiplam met NICE's criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but did not make a case for meeting the criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. The committee accepted that risdiplam did not meet the end-of-life criteria in the type 2 and 3 population because, although risdiplam may provide a survival benefit, life expectancy was likely to be over 2 years. For type 1 SMA, the company noted that survival depends on the nature and extent of supportive care. This may vary by country, NHS trust, clinician, and the preferences of patients and their families. The median age of death or permanent respiratory support in published natural history studies was 9 months to 13 months. The ERG commented that mean survival in the company's model for people with type 1 SMA having best supportive care was 4.88 years but this was likely to be an overestimate because of the way the company had applied the hazard ratios in the model (see section 3.10). The committee noted that it usually prefers to assess whether this criterion is met by referring to the mean survival predicted by the model. However, it accepted the limitations of the model in this case mean that estimates from the literature are more robust. The committee recognised that the life expectancy is uncertain but considered it reasonable to accept that risdiplam could meet the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA\" id=\"596-1-it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"596-1-3.15\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.15</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Having concluded that the short life-expectancy criterion was met for type 1 SMA, the committee recalled that the long-term survival estimates for these patients are very uncertain (see section 3.9).

The committee noted that nusinersen (TA588) was considered to have met the criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but not for types 2 or 3.

People with the condition have a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, and have worsening physical disability, mobility loss and respiratory dysfunction. SMA can be grouped into 5 main types (0 to 4), based on the age of onset and the maximum motor function reached. SMA type 0, the most severe, affects babies before birth. The babies do not develop any motor skills and often survive for only a few weeks after birth. Babies with type 1 SMA are unable to sit or roll because of severe muscle weakness, which gets worse over time. The muscle weakness also affects swallowing and breathing, and typically results in death within 2 years if respiratory support is not used. In type 2 SMA, the onset of symptoms is between 7 months and 18 months. People with this condition can sit independently at diagnosis. However, progressive loss of motor function means they have a reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. In type 3 SMA, there are varying degrees of muscle weakness, which appear between 18 months and 18 years. People with this condition can have a normal lifespan, and walk or sit unaided at some point, but many lose mobility and other functions over time. Type 4 SMA is the least severe and affects adults, who may have milder motor impairment and live a normal lifespan. The clinical experts explained that type 0 and type 4 SMA are rarely diagnosed in clinical practice in the NHS in England. The patient experts explained that SMA is a progressive disorder so all patients will experience more severe symptoms over time. The committee concluded that SMA is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disorder that affects all aspects of daily life.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam\" id=\"414-1-the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-current-sma-classification-system-has-limitations-but-has-been-used-in-the-marketing-authorisation-and-clinical-evidence-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The current SMA classification system has limitations but has been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"414-1-3.2\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.2</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The patient experts commented that the SMA classification system does not always reflect the full extent of the disease. The boundaries between the different SMA types are blurred and can be subjective. They also explained that it was not originally intended to define populations who were eligible for treatment. One patient expert with a child with type 3 SMA described how progressive loss of motor function has affected all daily activities and being unable to access treatments such as nusinersen has a big effect on physical and mental health. The committee understood that risdiplam's marketing authorisation includes types 1 to 3 SMA as currently defined by the SMA classification system and these definitions were also used in the clinical evidence (see section 3.5). The committee acknowledged the limitations of the current SMA classification system but concluded that it had been used in the marketing authorisation and clinical evidence for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families\" id=\"414-1-sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"sma-severely-affects-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-carers-and-their-families\" data-heading-type=\"section\">SMA severely affects the quality of life of patients, carers and their families</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"414-1-3.3\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.3</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The clinical and patient experts explained that most people with SMA need constant support. This can include full-time care and attention, needing physical effort (such as lifting and carrying) and causing loss of sleep for patients and carers, stress, and fear about loss of abilities. One patient expert with a child with type 2 SMA described how living with the condition can put considerable strain on relationships with other family members and friends. Siblings have a restricted social circle because of the fear of respiratory infections, and often act as young carers. As well as dealing with the physical and mental stress as the condition progresses, the financial burden also increases as more supportive equipment is needed. Another patient expert with type 2 SMA described the fear of losing fine motor skills and how being unable to work would affect the whole family. All these factors have a large effect on family members' health-related quality of life. The patient experts emphasised how caring for people with SMA affects the whole family and can cause physical, mental and financial issues. The committee concluded that SMA has a substantial effect on the quality of life of patients, caregivers and their families.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Comparator\" id=\"414-1-comparator\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"comparator\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Comparator</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam\" id=\"414-1-best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"best-supportive-care-is-the-most-appropriate-comparator-for-risdiplam\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"414-1-3.4\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.4</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Nusinersen is the only disease-modifying treatment currently available for SMA. The clinical and patient experts explained that many people with SMA have spinal fusion so cannot have nusinersen because it is delivered by intrathecal injection and requires access to the lower spine. They commented that an oral treatment option would be welcome and would also address several issues related to the delivery of nusinersen including the use of sedation, radiographic imaging and anxiety associated with lumbar puncture. Nusinersen is recommended in NICE's guidance TA588 through a managed access agreement. This makes nusinersen available while more data is collected. However, nusinersen is not routinely commissioned in the NHS in England. So, current treatment for many people is best supportive care. The aim is to control symptoms, maintain movement and function for as long as possible and improve quality of life. This involves a multidisciplinary approach including respiratory, gastroenterology and orthopaedic care, as well as nutritional support, physiotherapy, assistive technologies, occupational therapy and social care. However, the clinical and patient experts emphasised that these supportive treatments do not affect disease progression, so people with SMA will ultimately become dependent on their families and carers. The committee was aware of an ongoing highly specialised technology evaluation for <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-hst10026\" target=\"_top\">onasemnogene abeparvovec for treating spinal muscular atrophy type 1</a>. It was aware that this treatment was recommended in draft guidance for routine commissioning for some babies 12 months or younger with SMA type 1. However, it understood that the guidance was not final and therefore onasemnogene abeparvovec could not be included as a comparator. The NHS England commissioning expert described the potential treatment pathway if risdiplam were to be recommended as a treatment option alongside nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec. They explained that repeated treatment switching would only be expected in exceptional circumstances, related to issues such as fertility or side effects. The committee recognised that treatment options used routinely in the NHS in England are currently limited and there is an unmet need for people with SMA. It recalled that best supportive care is routinely used in clinical practice in the NHS in England. It concluded that best supportive care was the most appropriate comparator for risdiplam.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Clinical evidence\" id=\"414-1-clinical-evidence\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"clinical-evidence\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Clinical evidence</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3\" id=\"414-1-evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"evidence-from-sunfish-and-firefish-is-appropriate-for-decision-making-for-sma-types-1-to-3\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Evidence from SUNFISH and FIREFISH is appropriate for decision making for SMA types 1 to 3</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"414-1-3.5\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.5</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The main clinical effectiveness evidence for risdiplam came from 2 clinical studies:</p>\r\n          <ul class=\"itemizedlist indented\">\r\n            <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n              <p>SUNFISH, which is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre (excluding UK sites), phase 2, placebo-controlled trial.

The ERG considered that although SUNFISH excluded patients with type 3 SMA who could walk, this group accounts for a small proportion of SMA cases. It also noted that SUNFISH and FIREFISH excluded patients who had previous treatment (see section 3.6). The committee noted the age restrictions used in both studies. It was aware that some babies may be diagnosed with type 1 SMA when they are older than 7 months. The clinical experts explained that the study populations were generally representative of patients with SMA in the NHS in England. The committee concluded that the evidence presented for SMA types 1 to 3 was suitable for decision making.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen\" id=\"414-1-there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"there-is-no-clinical-or-cost-effectiveness-evidence-for-patients-who-have-had-nusinersen\" data-heading-type=\"section\">There is no clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for patients who have had nusinersen</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"414-1-3.6\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.6</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The company did not present any clinical or cost-effectiveness evidence for people who have had nusinersen.

The results from FIREFISH were compared against pre-defined performance criteria, based on natural history data for patients with type 1 SMA. The results (see table 2) suggest that after 12 months of treatment with risdiplam, more patients were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds than would be expected for patients with type 1 SMA. Overall survival was 93% (90% confidence interval 82.2% to 97.1%). After technical engagement, both the company and the ERG used the company's matched adjusted indirect comparison to model the treatment effect of risdiplam compared with best supportive care for type 1 SMA. The indirect comparison showed improvements in motor function (such as sitting with and without support), ventilation-free survival and overall survival (the company considers the data to be confidential so it cannot be reported here). The company and the ERG agreed that improvements seen in both SUNFISH and FIREFISH were clinically important. The patient experts described their experiences of using risdiplam and noted improvements in motor function, lung capacity, energy levels and stamina. They explained that even very small improvements in fine motor skills and upper limb function were very important because they allow patients to maintain independence. They emphasised that although the studies showed improvements in motor function, they would also highly value a treatment that keeps the disease stable and stops it getting worse. The committee agreed that the clinical evidence showed improved motor function with risdiplam but noted that overall survival data were only available for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n      <div class=\"informaltable\">\r\n        <table frame=\"all\" border=\"1\" id=\"ID0E2F\">\r\n          <caption>\r\n            <strong>Table 1 Results from SUNFISH for SMA types 2 and 3 at 12‑month follow up</strong>\r\n          </caption>\r\n          <thead>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Outcome</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Risdiplam n=120 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Placebo n=60 (SE)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>Difference, risdiplam minus placebo (95% CI)</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n              <th scope=\"col\">\r\n                <p>p-value</p>\r\n              </th>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </thead>\r\n          <tbody>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>MFM-32 total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.36 (0.38)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.19 (0.52) </p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.55 (0.30 to 2.81)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02*, 0.02**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>HFMSE total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.95 (0.33)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.37 (0.46)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.58 (–0.53 to 1.69)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.30**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>RULM total Score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.61 (0.31)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.02 (0.43)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.59 (0.55 to 2.62)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.05*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Caregiver-reported SMAIS score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.65 (0.50)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.91 (0.67)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>2.55 (0.93 to 4.17)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.39*, 0.00**</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>Patient-reported SMAIS total score</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.04 (0.65)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>–0.40 (0.86)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>1.45 (–0.68 to 3.57)</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <p>0.18</p>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>Table note: All data are least squares mean change from baseline.

Both models compared risdiplam with best supportive care. Health-state transitions were based on assessments of motor milestones using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Module 2 for type 1 SMA, and the 32 item Motor Function Measure and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. In the type 1 model, the ERG noted that the company's approach overestimates overall survival in the best supportive care arm. It stated that the company should have applied the hazard ratio to the best supportive care group instead of applying the inverse of the hazard ratio to the risdiplam group. After technical engagement, the company added a treatment-effect plateau similar to that used in TA588. The plateau assumed patients who have had risdiplam will not reach additional motor milestones after 66 months for SMA type 1 and 26 months for SMA type 2 or 3. The ERG explained that the company's models were broadly consistent with the final model used in TA588 but there were differences in the stopping rule and caregiver assumptions (see sections 0 and 3.13).

This restricted its use to a maximum of 50 years for type 1 SMA and 30 years for types 2 and 3 SMA. The committee noted that this approach differed to the stopping criteria in TA588, which was based on clinical outcomes including repeated loss of motor function, the need for ventilation and scoliosis. Clinical advice to the company suggested that a time-based rule may be easy to implement in the NHS in England and may be preferred to the current criteria set out in TA588 because it would avoid pressure for continuous motor milestone improvement. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the current stopping rules in TA588 were problematic and put undue strain on patients and their caregivers. The clinical expert suggested that a maximum treatment duration of 50 years would be reasonable for type 1 SMA, but 30 years may not be appropriate for types 2 and 3. This is because many adults may still benefit from risdiplam and it would be unfair to stop treatment for these people. The ERG preferred not to include the company's time-based stopping rule because it was not based on any evidence. But it noted that a stopping rule based on clinical criteria may improve risdiplam's cost-effectiveness. The clinical and patient experts agreed that the stopping rule used in TA588 is challenging to implement in clinical practice. So, the committee considered that appropriate stopping criteria should be explored in collaboration with clinical and patient experts and the wider SMA community. It was aware that there is ongoing work reviewing the TA588 stopping criteria for nusinersen and agreed that this could also be relevant for risdiplam. In the absence of updated criteria from TA588, the committee concluded that the company's stopping rules may not be appropriate and it would like to see stopping rules based on clinical criteria that have been agreed with clinical and patient experts.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Utility values\" id=\"414-1-utility-values\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"utility-values\" data-heading-type=\"section\">Utility values</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger\" id=\"414-1-the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-companys-utility-gain-for-fine-motor-skills-is-acceptable-but-there-is-uncertainty-around-the-exact-value-and-the-benefit-could-be-larger\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"414-1-3.12\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.12</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>After technical engagement, the company included in its base case an additional utility gain to reflect risdiplam's potential benefits in fine motor skills. The company applied a utility gain of 0.05 and 0.10 for patients treated with risdiplam in the non-sitting and sitting health states respectively, based on Thokala et al. (2010).

The committee was sympathetic to these arguments and noted that SUNFISH showed improvements in upper limb function at 12 months and also in the SMA independence scale (see table 1). It concluded that the company's utility gain for fine motor skills is acceptable but there is uncertainty around the exact value and the benefit could be larger.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"The ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with NICE's appraisal of nusinersen but there is substantial uncertainty\" id=\"414-1-the-ergs-approach-to-including-caregiver-utility-values-is-consistent-with-nices-appraisal-of-nusinersen-but-there-is-substantial-uncertainty\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"the-ergs-approach-to-including-caregiver-utility-values-is-consistent-with-nices-appraisal-of-nusinersen-but-there-is-substantial-uncertainty\" data-heading-type=\"section\">The ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with NICE's appraisal of nusinersen but there is substantial uncertainty</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"414-1-3.13\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.13</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Both the company and ERG included caregiver-related utility values but their approaches differed. The company used an additive approach and assumed that caregiver health-related quality of life increased linearly with each motor milestone that was met. The ERG explained that the company's additive approach assumed that after a patient died the caregiver health-related quality of life was zero. This increased the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains for risdiplam because patients live longer. The ERG did not think this was appropriate because it assumed society places value on caregivers of surviving patients with SMA but does not for bereaved caregivers. Submissions at technical engagement from patient and professional organisations emphasised that bereavement would have a significant and sustained effect on a caregiver's health-related quality of life. After technical engagement, the ERG presented its preferred analysis and 2 scenario analyses that explored the effects of bereavement. It preferred to apply a disutility (reduction in health-related quality of life) that was linked to the health state of the patient with SMA. But in the base case, after the patient died, the caregiver utility value was assumed to return to that of the general population. In the first scenario, the ERG applied a disutility of -0.04 from Song et al. (2010) for 20 years after the patient with SMA died and in the second scenario the same disutility was applied for the maximum time horizon (90 years). The ERG cautioned that the analyses were limited because they used arbitrary assumptions and the company's model did not include caregiver ageing or survival. The committee understood that the ERG's disutility approach was consistent with TA588 and was not aware of any previous technology appraisals that used the company's preferred additive approach to model caregiver utility values. It also noted that while the guide to the methods of technology evaluation states that when relevant, direct health effects for carers can be included in analyses, it is unclear whether this extends to valuing caregiver bereavement. It recalled that SMA has a substantial effect on carers and families as well as patients and can affect multiple members of the extended family (see section 3.3). It was aware that using the ERG's preferred disutility approach substantially increased the cost-effectiveness ratios, particularly for type 1 SMA. This was because the substantial caregiver disutilities were subtracted from the patient utility values, which themselves reflect a poor quality of life. So increased survival results in a low number of QALYs, but at a high extra cost. This was less of an issue for type 2 and type 3 SMA because the additional survival is associated with higher patient utility and lower carer disutility than in the type 1 model, meaning a higher number of QALYs can be accrued. The company noted that this was counterintuitive because it made a life-extending treatment appear to be less cost effective. It also noted that using the ERG's approach meant that risdiplam was not cost effective, even when there was no cost for risdiplam. The ERG explained that the cost-effectiveness of risdiplam was related to other factors including extended overall survival and high disease management costs. Also, the committee understood that the company preferred to assume each patient with SMA would have 2.2 caregivers. However, the ERG preferred to assume 3 caregivers for patients with type 2 or 3 SMA who cannot sit because this is consistent with TA588. The committee did not accept the company's approach to caregiver utility but recognised the difficulties in valuing caregiver utility values. It noted that the ERG approach also had limitations and resulted in particularly high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for type 1 SMA. Despite accepting the logic of the ERG's modelling, it did not agree that including carer quality of life would result in fewer QALYs being accrued by carers when risdiplam extends survival.  Therefore, it would welcome suggestions for alternative approaches for valuing caregiver quality of life in this appraisal. The committee concluded that the ERG's approach to including caregiver utility values is consistent with TA588 but neither the company's nor the ERG approach is ideal, so there is substantial uncertainty.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"End of life\" id=\"414-1-end-of-life\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"end-of-life\" data-heading-type=\"section\">End of life</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA\" id=\"414-1-it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-reasonable-to-accept-that-risdiplam-meets-the-short-life-expectancy-criterion-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is reasonable to accept that risdiplam meets the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"414-1-3.14\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.14</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>The committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg9\" target=\"_top\">guide to the methods of technology appraisal</a>. The company proposed that risdiplam met NICE's criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but did not make a case for meeting the criteria for SMA types 2 and 3. The committee accepted that risdiplam did not meet the end-of-life criteria in the type 2 and 3 population because, although risdiplam may provide a survival benefit, life expectancy was likely to be over 2 years. For type 1 SMA, the company noted that survival depends on the nature and extent of supportive care. This may vary by country, NHS trust, clinician, and the preferences of patients and their families. The median age of death or permanent respiratory support in published natural history studies was 9 months to 13 months. The ERG commented that mean survival in the company's model for people with type 1 SMA having best supportive care was 4.88 years but this was likely to be an overestimate because of the way the company had applied the hazard ratios in the model (see section 3.10). The committee noted that it usually prefers to assess whether this criterion is met by referring to the mean survival predicted by the model. However, it accepted the limitations of the model in this case mean that estimates from the literature are more robust. The committee recognised that the life expectancy is uncertain but considered it reasonable to accept that risdiplam could meet the short life-expectancy criterion for type 1 SMA.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA\" id=\"414-1-it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title annotator-chapter\" id=\"it-is-likely-that-risdiplam-extends-life-by-more-than-3months-for-type-1-sma\" data-heading-type=\"section\">It is likely that risdiplam extends life by more than 3 months for type 1 SMA</h4>\r\n      <article id=\"414-1-3.15\" class=\"numbered-paragraph annotator-numbered-paragraph\" data-heading-type=\"numbered-paragraph\">\r\n        <h5>3.15</h5>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <p>Having concluded that the short life-expectancy criterion was met for type 1 SMA, the committee recalled that the long-term survival estimates for these patients are very uncertain (see section 3.9).

The committee noted that nusinersen (TA588) was considered to have met the criteria for a life-extending treatment at the end of life for type 1 SMA, but not for types 2 or 3.
